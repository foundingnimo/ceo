# Episode 10: Financial Forecasting

**Estimated Time:** 40 Minutes

A budget is a plan. A forecast is a prediction of what will actually happen based on current information. Both are essential, but forecasts keep you grounded in reality.

## Part 1: Budget vs. Forecast

| Aspect | Budget | Forecast |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Set targets | Predict outcomes |
| **Timing** | Usually annual | Updated monthly/quarterly |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed for period | Adjusted on actuals |
| **Focus** | What we want | What we expect |

## Part 2: The Rolling Forecast

Instead of a static annual budget, use rolling forecasts:
- **Always** looking 12-18 months ahead
- Updated **monthly** or quarterly
- Incorporates **latest** information
- More **accurate** for planning

## Part 3: Building a Financial Model

Key assumptions to model:

| Category | Variables |
|----------|-----------|
| **Revenue** | New customers/month, avg deal size, churn rate |
| **Costs** | Headcount, salaries, variable costs |
| **Efficiency** | CAC, sales cycle length, win rate |

**Simple Monthly Projection:**
```
Month 1:
  New MRR: 10 customers × $1,000 = $10,000
  Churned MRR: $100,000 × 5%/12 = $417
  Net New MRR: $9,583
  Ending MRR: $100,000 + $9,583 = $109,583
```

## Part 4: Scenario Planning

Always build three scenarios:

| Scenario | Purpose | Key Assumptions |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Downside** | Understand risks | Lower win rate, higher churn |
| **Base Case** | Expected outcome | Current trends continue |
| **Upside** | Identify opportunity | Things go better than planned |

**Example Comparison:**
```
Metric          | Downside | Base   | Upside
Year-end ARR    | $1.0M    | $1.4M  | $1.8M
Cash at EOY     | $200K    | $500K  | $800K
Runway (months) | 4        | 10     | 16
```

## Part 5: Communicating Forecasts

When presenting to board/investors:
1. Lead with key metrics and trends
2. Explain major assumptions
3. Show comparison to budget
4. Highlight risks and opportunities
5. Present scenarios with probabilities
6. Recommend actions

## CEO Action Item: Scenario Exercise

Create three scenarios for the next 6 months:
1. What's your best case? What drives it?
2. What's your worst case? What triggers it?
3. What's the most likely outcome?
