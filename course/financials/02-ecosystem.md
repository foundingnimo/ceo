# Episode 2: The Financial Ecosystem

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

Your business is a financial ecosystem where money flows in, circulates, and flows out. Understanding this system is crucial for making informed decisions.

## Part 1: How Money Flows Through Your Business

```
Customer Payment (Revenue)
    ↓
Business Bank Account (Cash)
    ↓
Operating Expenses → Product Development → Marketing → Salaries
    ↓
Profit (or Loss)
    ↓
Reinvestment or Distribution

Every decision you make affects this flow. Hiring speeds up outflows. Closing deals speeds up inflows. Your job is to keep the system healthy.
