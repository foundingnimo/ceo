# Episode 3: Revenue vs. Cash

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

This is one of the most important concepts in business finance: **revenue is not cash**. Understanding this difference can literally save your company.

## Part 1: The Critical Distinction

| Concept | Definition | When It Happens |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Revenue** | When you earn the right to payment | When you deliver value |
| **Cash** | When money hits your bank account | When customer actually pays |

### Real Example:
You sell a $100,000 annual software contract in January:
- **Revenue**: Recognized over 12 months ($8,333/month)
- **Cash**: Might receive $100,000 upfront, or $8,333 monthly, or net-30 days after each month

**The Gap**: This timing difference can make or break your business.

## Part 2: Accrual vs. Cash Accounting

| Method | Records When | Best For | Limitation |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Accrual** | Revenue earned, expenses incurred | Most businesses | Doesn't show actual cash |
| **Cash** | Cash changes hands | Small businesses | Hides economic reality |

Most companies use accrual accounting. This means your Income Statement shows profit, but your bank account might tell a different story.

*Clear explanation of why profitable companies can still run out of cash.*

## Part 3: Why Profitable Companies Fail

A company can be "profitable" on paper but run out of cash if:
- Customers pay slowly (long receivables)
- You pay suppliers quickly (short payables)
- You're growing fast and need cash for hiring
- You have large upfront costs before revenue arrives

**SaaS Example:**
Many SaaS companies offer annual contracts paid monthly. Recognize $120K annual revenue, but only receive $10K/month. If you spend $15K/month, you're "profitable" but burning cash.
