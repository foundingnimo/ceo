# Episode 4: Introduction to Financial Statements

**Estimated Time:** 30 Minutes

Financial statements are the scorecards of business. There are three main statements, each telling a different part of your company's story.

## Part 1: The Three Core Statements

| Statement | What It Shows | Time Period | Key Question |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Income Statement (P&L)** | Did we make or lose money? | Specific period | "How profitable are we?" |
| **Balance Sheet** | What we own vs. what we owe | Snapshot in time | "What's our financial position?" |
| **Cash Flow Statement** | Where cash came from and went | Specific period | "Why did cash change?" |

## Part 2: How They Connect

```
Income Statement → Shows profit/loss
         ↓
Balance Sheet → Profit increases equity; shows assets/liabilities
         ↓
Cash Flow Statement → Explains why cash changed despite profit/loss
```

**Think of it like a person:**
- **Income Statement**: Their monthly paycheck and expenses (did they earn more than they spent?)
- **Balance Sheet**: Their net worth (what they own minus what they owe)
- **Cash Flow Statement**: Their bank account activity (where did money come and go?)

## Part 3: Why You Need All Three

You can't understand your business with just one statement:

| Scenario | What It Might Look Like | Which Statement Reveals Truth |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| High profit but no cash | P&L shows profit | Cash Flow shows where cash went |
| Lots of cash but losing money | Bank account looks good | Income Statement shows losses |
| Growing fast but unstable | Revenue climbing | Balance Sheet shows debt levels |
