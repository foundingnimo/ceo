## Part 2: Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **LTV:CAC** | LTV / CAC | > 3:1 |
| **CAC Payback** | CAC / (Monthly ARPA × GM) | < 12 months |
| **Magic Number** | Net New ARR / Prior S&M Spend | > 0.75 |
| **Rule of 40** | Growth Rate + Profit Margin | > 40% |

## Part 3: The Rule of 40

```
Rule of 40 = Revenue Growth Rate + Profit Margin
```

| Example | Growth | Margin | Score |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Growth-focused | 60% | -20% | 40% ✓ |
| Balanced | 35% | 10% | 45% ✓ |
| Profit-focused | 15% | 30% | 45% ✓ |
| Underperforming | 20% | 10% | 30% ❌ |

## Part 4: Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

The most important SaaS metric:

```
NRR = (Start MRR + Expansion - Churn - Contraction) / Start MRR
```

| NRR | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **< 90%** | Bucket is leaking badly |
| **90-100%** | Treading water |
| **100-110%** | Good, expansion covers churn |
| **110-130%** | Excellent |
| **> 130%** | World-class |
