## Part 2: The SaaS Unit Economics Framework

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **CAC** | S&M Spend / New Customers | Lower is better |
| **LTV** | (ARPA × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate | Higher is better |
| **LTV:CAC** | LTV / CAC | > 3:1 |
| **CAC Payback** | CAC / (Monthly ARPA × Gross Margin) | < 12 months |

## Part 3: Calculating LTV:CAC

**Customer Acquisition Cost:**
```
Monthly S&M Spend: $500,000
New Customers: 50
CAC = $10,000 per customer
```

**Lifetime Value:**
```
ARPA: $1,000/month ($12,000/year)
Gross Margin: 80%
Annual Churn: 10%
LTV = $12,000 × 0.80 / 0.10 = $96,000
```

**The Ratio:**
```
LTV:CAC = $96,000 / $10,000 = 9.6:1 ✓
```

## Part 4: LTV:CAC Benchmarks

| Ratio | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **< 1:1** | Losing money on every customer ❌ |
| **1:1 to 3:1** | Barely profitable, needs improvement |
| **3:1 to 5:1** | Healthy business ✓ |
| **> 5:1** | Very efficient (or under-investing in growth) |

## Part 5: CAC Payback Period

```
CAC Payback = CAC / (Monthly ARPA × Gross Margin)
            = $10,000 / ($1,000 × 0.80)
            = 12.5 months
```

| Payback | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| **< 12 months** | Excellent ✓ |
| **12-18 months** | Good |
| **18-24 months** | Needs improvement |
| **> 24 months** | Problematic |
