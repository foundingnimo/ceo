## Part 5: Monitoring Budget Variance

```
Category     | Budget  | Actual | Variance
Revenue      | $100K   | $95K   | -5%
Gross Profit | $80K    | $77K   | -4%
S&M          | $40K    | $45K   | -13% ⚠️
R&D          | $25K    | $25K   | 0%
G&A          | $15K    | $14K   | +7%
```

Ask for each variance: Is it one-time or recurring? Controllable? What action needed?
