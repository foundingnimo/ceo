```

|-------------|------------------|
| < 20% | 2-5x |
| 20-40% | 5-10x |
| 40-80% | 10-20x |
| > 80% | 15-30x+ |

## Part 4: Term Sheet Basics

**Key Terms:**
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Pre-money** | Value before investment |
| **Post-money** | Pre-money + investment |
| **Dilution** | Reduction in ownership % |
| **Liquidation Preference** | Payout order in exit |

**Example:**
```
Pre-money: $10M
Investment: $5M
Post-money: $15M
Investor ownership: $5M / $15M = 33.3%
```
