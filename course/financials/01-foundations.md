# Episode 1: Financial Literacy Foundations

**Estimated Time:** 15 Minutes

Financial literacy is your superpower as a CEO. Many tech startups fail not because of bad products, but because of poor financial management. This episode establishes why this matters and sets the foundation.

## Part 1: Why Financial Literacy Matters

As a CEO, you need financial literacy because:
- **Cash flow mismanagement** is a leading cause of startup failure
- **Investors expect** you to speak the language of finance
- **Financial data tells the story** of your business health
- **Strategic decisions** require financial understanding

## Part 2: The Language of Finance

Master these six fundamental terms first:

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Revenue** | Money coming in from sales | $100K from software subscriptions |
| **Expenses** | Money going out to run the business | $80K for salaries, hosting, rent |
| **Profit** | Revenue minus expenses | $20K left over |
| **Assets** | Things the company owns | Cash, equipment, IP |
| **Liabilities** | Things the company owes | Loans, unpaid bills |
| **Equity** | Ownership value in the company | Assets minus Liabilities |

## Part 3: Accounting vs. Finance

Two related but different disciplines:

- **Accounting**: Recording and reporting what happened (backward-looking)
- **Finance**: Planning and decision-making for the future (forward-looking)

As CEO, you need both: understanding the past to plan the future.

## CEO Action Item: Financial Self-Assessment

Write down three financial decisions you've made in the past month. For each, identify:
1. What financial information did you use?
2. What additional data would have helped?
3. How confident were you in the decision?
