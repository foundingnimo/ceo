## Part 1: The Financial CEO Mindset

## Part 2: Investment Decision Framework

**Return on Investment (ROI):**
```
ROI = (Gains - Investment) / Investment × 100%
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Payback = Investment / Annual Return
```

**Example - New Sales Rep:**
```
Investment: $150K/year (salary + overhead)
Expected quota: $500K pipeline → $150K revenue
Gross margin: 75%
Gross profit: $112,500
Year 1 ROI: ($112,500 - $150K) / $150K = -25%

But... Year 2 (ramped): $150K GP
Year 3 (mature): $180K GP
+ Recurring revenue continues...
Long-term ROI: Positive ✓
```

## Part 3: Common CEO Financial Decisions

| Decision | Key Questions |
|----------|---------------|
| **Hire vs. Don't Hire** | What revenue/impact will this enable? Fully-loaded cost? Time to productivity? |
| **Build vs. Buy** | Cost to build (time, people)? Cost to buy (price, integration)? Speed to value? |
| **Grow vs. Profit** | ROI on growth investments? Runway needed? Can we grow efficiently? |
| **Raise vs. Bootstrap** | Capital needed? Dilution acceptable? Growth upside worth it? |

## Part 4: The Trade-off Triangle

```
        Growth
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
      /      \
Profitability --- Cash
```

**You can optimize for two, but usually sacrifice the third.**

## Part 5: Financial Red Flags

| Red Flag | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Declining gross margin | Pricing pressure | Review pricing |
| Increasing CAC | Harder to acquire | Audit channels |
| Decreasing NRR | Customers leaving | Improve product |
| Rising burn without growth | Inefficient spending | Cut costs |
| Runway < 6 months | Survival risk | Fundraise NOW |

1. Review financials weekly
2. Ask "what's the ROI?" for every investment
