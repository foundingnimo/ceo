# Episode 7: Mastering the Cash Flow Statement

**Estimated Time:** 40 Minutes

The Cash Flow Statement is often called the most important financial statement because **cash is king**. It explains exactly where cash came from and where it went.

## Part 1: Why Cash Flow Matters More Than Profit

**You can't pay employees with profit. You can't pay rent with profit. You pay with CASH.**

The cash flow statement reconciles the difference between:
- What the income statement says (profit/loss)
- What actually happened in your bank account (cash change)

## Part 2: Three Sections of Cash Flow

| Section | What It Shows | Healthy Sign |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Operating Activities** | Cash from running the business | Positive (at scale) |
| **Investing Activities** | Cash from buying/selling assets | Negative (you're investing) |
| **Financing Activities** | Cash from investors/lenders | Positive (if growing) |

**The Complete Picture:**
```
Cash from Operating Activities     +/- 
Cash from Investing Activities     +/-
Cash from Financing Activities     +/-
= Net Change in Cash               +/-

Beginning Cash + Net Change = Ending Cash
```
