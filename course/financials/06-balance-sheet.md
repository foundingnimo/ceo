# Episode 6: Mastering the Balance Sheet

**Estimated Time:** 45 Minutes

The Balance Sheet is a snapshot of your company's financial position at a specific moment. It shows what you own (assets), what you owe (liabilities), and what's left over for owners (equity).

## Part 1: The Fundamental Equation

```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

This equation **always** balances—hence "balance" sheet.

## Part 2: Balance Sheet Structure

**ASSETS** (What You Own)
| Category | Examples | Timeframe |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Current Assets | Cash, Accounts Receivable, Prepaid | < 1 year to cash |
| Fixed Assets | Equipment, Property, Intangibles | Long-term |

**LIABILITIES** (What You Owe)
| Category | Examples | Timeframe |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Current Liabilities | Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, Deferred Revenue | Due < 1 year |
| Long-term Liabilities | Loans, Leases | Due > 1 year |

**EQUITY** (What's Left)
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Common Stock | Money invested by shareholders |
| Retained Earnings | Accumulated profits (or losses) |

## Part 3: Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Current Ratio** | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | > 1.5 |
| **Quick Ratio** | (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities | > 1.0 |
| **Debt-to-Equity** | Total Liabilities / Total Equity | Varies |
| **Working Capital** | Current Assets - Current Liabilities | Positive |

## Part 4: SaaS Special Consideration

**Deferred Revenue is actually a GOOD thing for SaaS!**
- Represents cash collected upfront for future services
- Shows customer commitment
- Provides working capital
- High deferred revenue = strong cash position

It's a liability because you owe the service, but it's cash in your bank.

## Part 5: Red Flags

- ⚠️ Current ratio below 1.0 (can't pay short-term obligations)
- ⚠️ Declining cash with continuing losses
- ⚠️ Accounts receivable aging (customers not paying)
- ⚠️ Negative equity (liabilities exceed assets)
