# Episode 8: Cash Flow Management Essentials

**Estimated Time:** 40 Minutes

As your CEO augmentation plan states: "Cash flow management represents perhaps the most critical financial skill for startup CEOs."

A significant percentage of startups fail not because they lack a viable business model, but because they run out of cash before achieving sustainability.

## Part 1: Understanding Your Cash Position

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Gross Burn** | Total monthly cash outflows | Minimize waste |
| **Net Burn** | Cash outflows - Cash inflows | Trending toward zero |
| **Runway** | Current Cash / Monthly Net Burn | 12-18+ months |

**Example:**
```
Current Cash: $2,000,000
Monthly Revenue: $150,000
Monthly Expenses: $250,000
Net Burn Rate: $100,000/month
Runway: 20 months
```
