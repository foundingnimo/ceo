# Episode 12: Pricing Strategy Fundamentals

**Estimated Time:** 35 Minutes

Pricing is the most powerful lever for profitability. A 1% improvement in price yields more profit than a 1% improvement in volume, cost, or any other variable.

## Part 1: The Pricing Impact

```
Starting Position:
Revenue: $1,000,000
Costs: $900,000
Profit: $100,000 (10% margin)

With 1% Price Increase:
Revenue: $1,010,000
Costs: $900,000
Profit: $110,000 → 10% profit improvement!
```

## Part 2: Pricing Models

| Model | How It Works | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Cost-Plus** | Cost + Markup | Commodities |
| **Competitive** | Relative to competitors | Me-too products |
| **Value-Based** | Based on customer value | Differentiated products |
| **Usage-Based** | Varies with consumption | Cloud/API services |

**Value-Based is most profitable** when done well—you capture a share of the value you create for customers.

## Part 3: SaaS Pricing Strategies

**Tiered Pricing:**
```
Basic:      $29/month  - Core features
Pro:        $99/month  - Advanced features
Enterprise: Custom     - Full platform + support
```

**Per-Seat Pricing:**
```
Price = Base + ($X × Number of Users)
```

**Hybrid Models:**
- Platform fee + usage
- Per-seat + feature tiers
- Base + success fees

## Part 4: Pricing Psychology

| Technique | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Anchoring** | Show expensive option first |
| **Decoy Effect** | Three options make middle attractive |
| **Price Endings** | $99 vs $100 perception |
| **Bundling** | Increase perceived value |

## Part 5: Testing and Optimizing

**How to test pricing:**
1. Test with new customers (don't confuse existing)
2. Track conversion rates at different price points
3. Measure impact on LTV, not just initial sale
4. Consider A/B testing different price points

**Grandfather clauses:**
- Protect existing customers from increases
- Apply new prices to new customers only
- Gradually migrate or maintain indefinitely
