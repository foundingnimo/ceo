# Episode 5: Mastering the Income Statement

**Estimated Time:** 45 Minutes

The Income Statement (also called P&L or Profit & Loss Statement) is the first financial statement CEOs learn to read. It answers the fundamental question: **"Did we make money?"**

## Part 1: Income Statement Structure

```
Revenue (Sales)
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses
  - Sales & Marketing (S&M)
  - Research & Development (R&D)
  - General & Administrative (G&A)
= Operating Income (EBITDA)
- Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization
= Net Income (Bottom Line)
```

## Part 2: Key Line Items Explained

| Line Item | What It Is | SaaS Example |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Revenue** | Total money earned from customers | Subscriptions, services |
| **COGS** | Direct costs to deliver product | Hosting, support, payment fees |
| **Gross Profit** | Revenue minus COGS | What you have to cover operations |
| **OpEx** | Costs to run the business | Salaries, rent, marketing |
| **Net Income** | Bottom line after everything | Profit or loss |

## Part 3: Key Metrics to Calculate

| Metric | Formula | SaaS Benchmark |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Gross Margin** | Gross Profit / Revenue × 100% | 70-85% |
| **Operating Margin** | Operating Income / Revenue × 100% | Negative → 15-25% at scale |
| **Net Margin** | Net Income / Revenue × 100% | Varies by stage |

## Part 4: SaaS OpEx Benchmarks

| Category | Early Stage | Growth Stage | At Scale |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| S&M | 50-80% | 40-50% | 20-30% |
| R&D | 30-50% | 20-30% | 15-20% |
| G&A | 15-25% | 10-15% | 8-12% |

## Part 5: Red Flags to Watch

- ⚠️ Declining gross margins (pricing pressure or rising costs)
- ⚠️ S&M growing faster than revenue (inefficient growth)
- ⚠️ G&A growing faster than revenue (operational bloat)
- ⚠️ Widening losses without revenue growth
