# Episode 5: The Metrics That Matter

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "What gets measured gets managed." — Peter Drucker

In GTM, vanity metrics (website visits, LinkedIn followers) feel good but predict nothing. The metrics below tell you if your revenue engine is healthy, scalable, and profitable.

## Part 1: The Unit Economics Triangle

These three numbers determine if your business can scale:

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Benchmark |
|:-------|:--------|:------------------|
| **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost) | (Sales + Marketing spend) / New customers | Lower than 1/3 of LTV |
| **LTV** (Lifetime Value) | ARPU × Gross Margin × Customer Lifetime | 3x+ CAC |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | LTV / CAC | >3:1 (ideally 5:1) |

**Why this matters:** LTV:CAC < 3 means you're burning money to acquire customers. Investors and your balance sheet will notice.

## Part 2: The Payback Period

How long until a customer "pays back" what you spent to acquire them?

**CAC Payback = CAC / (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin)**

| Payback Period | What It Means |
|:---------------|:--------------|
| < 12 months | 🟢 Healthy. You can invest aggressively in growth. |
| 12-18 months | 🟡 Okay. Watch cash runway carefully. |
| > 18 months | 🔴 Danger. You'll run out of cash trying to scale. |

**CEO insight:** VCs love CAC payback < 12 months. It proves your GTM engine is capital-efficient.

## Part 3: Sales Velocity

How fast are you making money? Sales velocity combines four levers:

**Sales Velocity = (# Opportunities × Avg Deal Size × Win Rate) / Sales Cycle Length**

| Lever | How to Improve It |
|:------|:------------------|
| **# Opportunities** | More pipeline (marketing, SDRs, expansion) |
| **Deal Size** | Upsell, bundle, target larger ICP |
| **Win Rate** | Better qualification, sales training, positioning |
| **Sales Cycle** | Remove friction, multi-thread deals |

When velocity stalls, diagnose *which lever* is broken before throwing more reps at the problem.

## Part 4: The Conversion Funnel

Track conversion rates at every stage:

```
Leads → MQLs → SQLs → Opportunities → Closed Won
      ↓        ↓        ↓              ↓
    (X%)     (Y%)     (Z%)          (Win%)
```

**Benchmark SaaS conversion rates:**
- MQL → SQL: 30-40%
- SQL → Opportunity: 50-60%
- Opportunity → Closed Won: 20-30%

If any stage is dramatically off benchmark, investigate before scaling.

## Part 5: Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

| Leading (Predictive) | Lagging (Outcome) |
|:---------------------|:------------------|
| Pipeline created this month | Revenue closed this month |
| Discovery calls completed | Win rate |
| Demo requests | Average deal size |
| Website traffic | Churn rate |

**CEO insight:** Your weekly sales meeting should review *leading* indicators. By the time lagging metrics move, it's too late to course-correct.

## CEO Action Item: Calculate Your Core Metrics

Pull these numbers (estimate if needed):
1. **CAC:** Total sales + marketing spend last quarter / New customers acquired
2. **LTV:** Average monthly revenue × Gross margin × Avg customer lifetime (months)
3. **LTV:CAC Ratio:** Divide LTV by CAC

*Is your ratio above 3:1? If not, you have a leaky bucket problem—either CAC is too high or churn (LTV) is too bad.*
