# Episode 1: Know Your Customer (Ideal Customer Profile)

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "If you're selling to everyone, you're selling to no one." — David Cancel

The single biggest GTM mistake is chasing every opportunity. Companies with a well-defined Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) close deals faster, retain customers longer, and waste fewer resources on poor-fit prospects.

## Part 1: What is an ICP?

Your ICP is a detailed description of the company (not person) that would get *the most value* from your product. This is NOT your TAM (Total Addressable Market). It's the subset where:
- The pain is acute (they'll pay to solve it)
- Your solution is a strong fit (high success rate)
- Deal economics work (reasonable CAC, strong LTV)

## Part 2: The ICP Framework

Build your ICP across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Example |
|:----------|:---------|:--------|
| **Firmographics** | What size, industry, geography? | 50-500 employees, B2B SaaS, North America |
| **Technographics** | What tools do they use? | Salesforce, AWS, Slack |
| **Pain Signals** | What triggers their need? | Series A funding, new VP of Sales hire |
| **Anti-patterns** | Who should we *not* pursue? | Agencies, companies under 20 employees |

## Part 3: ICP vs. Buyer Persona

These are different concepts:

| ICP | Buyer Persona |
|:----|:--------------|
| Describes the *company* | Describes the *person* |
| Used for targeting/prospecting | Used for messaging/content |
| "Who should we sell to?" | "Who do we need to convince?" |

## CEO Action Item: The 15-Minute ICP Draft

Take 15 minutes and answer:
1. List your 3 best customers (highest NRR, fastest sales cycle, lowest support burden).
2. What do they have in common? (size, industry, tech stack, buying trigger)
3. Who should you *stop* pursuing? List 2-3 anti-patterns from bad-fit deals.

*This draft becomes your qualification filter. Every lead should be scored against it.*
