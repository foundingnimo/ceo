> "Selling isn't something you do *to* someone. It's something you do *for* someone." — Zig Ziglar

A repeatable sales process transforms selling from an art (dependent on individual talent) into a system (that scales with headcount). Without it, you can't forecast, can't diagnose problems, and can't train new hires.

## Part 1: The Sales Stages

Every B2B sale moves through predictable stages. Define yours clearly:

| Stage | Exit Criteria | Typical Activities |
|:------|:--------------|:-------------------|
| **1. Prospecting** | Meeting scheduled | Research, cold outreach, inbound response |
| **2. Discovery** | Pain confirmed, authority identified | Qualify need, budget, timeline, stakeholders |
| **3. Demo/POC** | Technical validation complete | Product demonstration, proof of concept |
| **4. Proposal** | Pricing delivered, legal engaged | Pricing, contract negotiation |
| **5. Negotiation** | Terms agreed | Final objection handling, approvals |
| **6. Closed Won/Lost** | Signed or lost | Contract signed OR loss reason documented |

**The key:** Each stage must have *clear exit criteria*. Loose definitions = garbage pipeline data.

## Part 2: The Qualification Framework

Not every opportunity deserves pursuit. Use MEDDIC (or BANT) to qualify:

| Letter | Meaning | Question to Answer |
|:-------|:--------|:-------------------|
| **M** | Metrics | What's the measurable impact of solving this? |
| **E** | Economic Buyer | Who signs the check? Have we met them? |
| **D** | Decision Criteria | What factors will determine their choice? |
| **D** | Decision Process | What are the steps to getting a 'yes'? |
| **I** | Identify Pain | What's the cost of *not* solving this? |
| **C** | Champion | Who inside will sell for us when we're not there? |

**CEO insight:** If your team can't answer these for a deal, it's not qualified. Unqualified deals clog pipelines and destroy forecasts.

## Part 3: The Revenue Org Structure

As you scale, you need specialized roles:

| Role | Focus | Metric |
|:-----|:------|:-------|
| **SDR/BDR** | Generate meetings from outbound | Meetings booked, MQL → SAL conversion |
| **AE** | Close deals | Revenue closed, win rate, deal velocity |
| **CSM** | Retain and expand | NRR, churn, expansion revenue |

**The hand-off is critical.** Document exactly when leads move between roles and what information must transfer.

## Part 4: The Sales Playbook

A playbook codifies how your best reps sell. It includes:

1. **ICP and qualification criteria** (who to pursue)
2. **Objection handling** (common pushbacks + responses)
3. **Discovery questions** (what to ask in first calls)
4. **Demo script** (key value moments to hit)
5. **Competitive positioning** (how to handle competitor mentions)
6. **Email/call templates** (proven outreach sequences)

Without a playbook, every new hire invents their own approach. Ramp time explodes, and consistency dies.

## CEO Action Item: Map Your Current Process

Draw your sales stages on paper:

1. List each stage a deal goes through (even if informal)
2. For each stage: What's the exit criteria? (Be honest—if it's vague, write "unclear")
3. Circle the stage where deals stall most often

*This reveals your biggest pipeline bottleneck. Fix that stage first.*
