# Episode 3: Choose Your GTM Motion

**Estimated Time:** 30 Minutes

> "The biggest mistake founders make is copying another company's GTM playbook without understanding why it worked for them." — Mark Roberge

There is no universal "best" way to sell. Your GTM motion must match your product, market, and deal economics. Choose wrong, and you'll either burn cash on an unsustainable sales team or leave enterprise revenue on the table.

## Part 1: The Three Core Motions

| Motion | How It Works | Best For | Key Metric |
|:-------|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
| **Product-Led Growth (PLG)** | Users try before they buy (free tier/trial) | Low ACV (<$10K), simple onboarding, viral potential | Activation rate, PQL conversion |
| **Sales-Led Growth (SLG)** | Dedicated sales team drives deals | High ACV (>$25K), complex sales, multiple stakeholders | Pipeline coverage, win rate |
| **Hybrid** | PLG for entry, sales for expansion | Mid-market, land-and-expand | PQL → SQL conversion |

## Part 2: The Decision Matrix

Use this to evaluate your fit:

| Factor | Favors PLG | Favors SLG |
|:-------|:-----------|:-----------|
| **ACV** | <$10K/year | >$25K/year |
| **Buyer** | End user can buy | Committee decision |
| **Complexity** | Self-serve onboarding | Needs implementation |
| **Sales Cycle** | Days to weeks | Months |
| **Competition** | Trying before competitor | Relationship-driven |

Most B2B SaaS companies end up **Hybrid**: PLG for SMB acquisition + Sales for enterprise conversion.

## Part 3: Account-Based Marketing (ABM)

For high-value target accounts, mass marketing doesn't work. ABM flips the funnel:

**Traditional:** Generate leads → Qualify → Sell
**ABM:** Identify target accounts → Personalize outreach → Engage stakeholders

ABM works when:
- You have a defined list of <500 target accounts
- Deal sizes justify personalized effort ($50K+ ACV)
- You can identify and reach multiple stakeholders

## Part 4: The Founder-Led Sales Trap

Every company starts with founder-led sales. The trap is staying there too long.

**Signs you're stuck:**
- CEO/founder is still closing majority of deals
- No documented sales process exists
- New sales hires can't replicate founder success
- Pipeline depends on founder's network

**The transition path:**
1. Document every step of how *you* sell
2. Hire a senior AE who can operate the playbook
3. Measure and iterate until they can close without you
4. Only then, scale the team

## CEO Action Item: The GTM Audit

Answer these questions honestly:
1. What is your current primary motion? (PLG / SLG / Founder-led chaos)
2. Based on your ACV and buyer, is this the *right* motion?
3. If you're still founder-led: What's the one thing blocking you from hiring your first dedicated seller?

*Write down your answers. This clarity determines your next 6 months of GTM investment.*
