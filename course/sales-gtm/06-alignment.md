# Episode 6: The Aligned Engine

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

> "Alignment is the invisible force multiplier. Misalignment is the invisible tax on everything you do."

The fastest way to destroy GTM performance is internal friction. When Sales blames Marketing for bad leads, Marketing blames Sales for not following up, and Product ignores both—everyone loses. Your job is to build one seamless revenue engine.

## Part 1: Symptoms of Misalignment

Recognize these patterns?

| Symptom | Root Cause |
|:--------|:-----------|
| "Marketing sends garbage leads" | No shared definition of MQL/SQL |
| "Sales doesn't follow up on leads" | No SLA on response time |
| "Product never builds what customers want" | No feedback loop from Sales → Product |
| "We keep losing to competitors on features" | No win/loss analysis shared with Product |
| "Every team uses different data" | No single source of truth |

## Part 2: The Revenue Team Concept

Stop treating Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success as separate silos. They are one revenue team with different functions:

| Function | Role in Revenue | Key Handoff |
|:---------|:----------------|:------------|
| **Marketing** | Generate demand, build brand, nurture leads | MQL → SDR |
| **Sales (SDR)** | Qualify and book meetings | SQL → AE |
| **Sales (AE)** | Close deals | Closed deal → CSM |
| **Customer Success** | Retain, expand, advocate | Renewal/expansion → AE (for upsell) |

**Document every handoff.** What information must be passed? Who is responsible? What's the SLA?

## Part 3: The Marketing ↔ Sales SLA

Create a written agreement between Marketing and Sales:

**Marketing commits to:**
- Deliver X MQLs per month that meet these criteria: [list]
- Average lead score of Y
- Response to Sales feedback within 48 hours

**Sales commits to:**
- Follow up on every MQL within 4 hours
- Update CRM with disposition (qualified/disqualified + reason)
- Provide win/loss feedback to Marketing monthly

Without an SLA, blame replaces accountability.

## Part 4: The Sales → Product Feedback Loop

Your sales team talks to customers daily. That intelligence is gold—if it reaches Product:

| Feedback Type | How to Capture | Frequency |
|:--------------|:---------------|:----------|
| **Feature requests** | CRM field or shared doc | Ongoing |
| **Objection patterns** | Weekly sales huddle notes | Weekly |
| **Win/loss reasons** | Structured win/loss interviews | Per deal |
| **Competitive intel** | Competitor mention tracking | Ongoing |

**Schedule monthly Product ↔ Sales syncs.** Product shares roadmap; Sales shares patterns from the field.

## Part 5: Shared Metrics = Shared Accountability

Everyone should see the same dashboard:

| Metric | Who Owns It | Who Cares |
|:-------|:------------|:----------|
| Pipeline generated | Marketing | Everyone |
| MQL → SQL conversion | Sales (SDR) | Marketing, Sales |
| Win rate | Sales (AE) | Everyone |
| Net Revenue Retention | CS | Everyone |
| CAC Payback | CEO/Finance | Everyone |

When metrics are shared, finger-pointing decreases and collaboration increases.

## CEO Action Item: The Alignment Audit

Answer these questions (be honest):

1. Do Sales and Marketing share a written definition of a "qualified lead"? (Yes/No)
2. Is there a documented SLA for lead follow-up time? (Yes/No)  
3. When was the last time Product and Sales met to share customer feedback? (Date)
4. Does everyone on the GTM team see the same revenue dashboard? (Yes/No)

*For every "No" or "I don't know": that's your alignment gap. Fix one this week.*
