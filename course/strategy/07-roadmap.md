# Episode 7: The Roadmap (Strategic Alignment)

**Estimated Time:** 15 Minutes

You have a vision. You have a competitive edge. You have OKRs. Now, you need a timeline. A strategic roadmap is a visualization of how your initiatives will unfold over time.

## Part 1: Roadmaps vs. Project Plans
- **Project Plan:** Deeply tactical. Tasks, owners, Jira tickets, deadlines.
- **Strategic Roadmap:** High-level. Themes, milestones, outcomes.

As CEO, you own the Roadmap. Your SVPs/Managers own the Project Plans.

## Part 2: Technology Roadmapping
In a tech company, your business strategy *is* your tech strategy. If your strategy is to "Be the global leader in AI-driven healthcare," but your roadmap shows you spending 6 months on "UI Refactor," you have a **Strategic Disconnect.**

## CEO Action Item: The Disconnect Check
1. Look at your 3-year Vision (from Episode 1).
2. Look at your product/tech roadmap for the next 6 months.
3. Ask: "Is the work we are doing today building the foundation for the company we want to be in 3 years?"
4. If not, what is **one thing** you need to stop doing to make room for what matters?
