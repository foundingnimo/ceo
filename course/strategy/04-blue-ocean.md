# Episode 4: Red Oceans vs. Blue Oceans

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

Most CEOs think strategy is about beating the competition. It isn't. Strategy is about making the competition irrelevant.

## Part 1: Value Innovation
- **Red Oceans:** Existing market space where boundaries are defined. Competition is fierce, turning products into commodities. It's a "bloody" fight for market share.
- **Blue Oceans:** Uncontested market space. You create a new demand by offering a unique value proposition that doesn't exist yet.

## Part 2: The Four Actions Framework
To find your Blue Ocean, you must ask four questions about your current industry's standards:
1. **Eliminate:** Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
2. **Reduce:** Which factors should be reduced well below the industry standard?
3. **Raise:** Which factors should be raised well above the industry standard?
4. **Create:** Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?

## CEO Action Item: The Erase-Create Test
Look at your product through the lens of the Four Actions:
- What is one thing you are doing just "because everyone else does it"? Can you **Eliminate** it?
- What is one thing your customers *actually* value that no one else is doing? Can you **Create** it?
