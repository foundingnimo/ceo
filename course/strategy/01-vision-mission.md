# Episode 1: The North Star (Vision & Mission)

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

> "Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things." — Peter Drucker

As a CEO, your first job isn't to tell people *what* to do, but *why* they are doing it. Without a clear "North Star," your team will drift into whatever project feels most urgent, rather than what is most important.

## Part 1: Start With Why
Most companies can tell you *what* they do (we sell software) and *how* they do it (we have a proprietary algorithm). Very few can clearly articulate **why** they do it.

*Focus on the "Golden Circle" concept: Why, How, What.*

## Part 2: Vision vs. Mission
These terms are often used interchangeably, but they serve different purposes:

| Feature | Mission | Vision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Question** | Why do we exist? | Where are we going? |
| **Window** | The Present (What we do every day) | The Future (Where we want to be in 10 years) |
| **Audience** | Primarily employees and customers | Primarily leadership and investors |

**Example (Google):**
- **Mission:** To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
- **Vision:** To provide access to the world’s information in one click.

## CEO Action Item: The Purpose Draft
Take 10 minutes and answer these three questions for your company:
1. If we disappeared tomorrow, what would the world lose? (The Why)
2. What are we uniquely gifted at doing for our customers? (The How)
3. In 10 years, what does the "victory" version of this company look like? (The Vision)

MISSION (Why we exist)
"We exist to break healthcare's interoperability crisis so that innovative software can actually reach patients and clinicians - instead of being trapped behind integration hell that wastes billions and fragments care."

VISION (Where we're going in 10 years)
"In 10 years, healthcare interoperability is invisible. Clinics switch tools like apps. Patients never re-enter data. Clinicians focus on care, not copy-pasting. Integration is taken for granted, like electricity.
