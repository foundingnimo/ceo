# Episode 6: Execution (OKRs)

**Estimated Time:** 35 Minutes

Strategy is 10% design and 90% execution. Most strategies fail because they live in a PDF on a server. **OKRs** (Objectives and Key Results) are the bridge between your "Vision" and the "Work."

## Part 1: What are OKRs?
Popularized by John Doerr (at Intel and Google), OKRs consist of:
- **Objective:** *What* do we want to achieve? (Qualitative, aspirational, memorable).
- **Key Results:** *How* do we know we achieved it? (Quantitative, measurable, objective).

*Understand why OKRs must be transparent and ambitious.*

## Part 2: The CEO’s OKR Checklist
1. **Focus:** Only set 3–5 Objectives. If everything is a priority, nothing is.
2. **Alignment:** Ensure every department's OKRs roll up into yours.
3. **Commitment:** Review progress weekly. OKRs are a living dashboard, not a "set and forget."

## CEO Action Item: Your First OKR
Draft **one** Objective for your company for the next 90 days.
*Example: "Launch our new mobile app with high user satisfaction."*

Now, list **three** Key Results that prove you did it.
*Example:*
1. *App Store rating of 4.5+ stars.*
2. *10,000 active users in the first 30 days.*
3. *Zero critical bugs reported in week 4.*
