# Episode 3: The Battlefield (Porter's Five Forces)

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

A CEO needs to understand industry structure. Some industries are naturally "easy" (high margins, low competition) while others are "hard." Porter’s Five Forces helps you understand which one you are in and why.

## Part 1: The Five Forces
Developed by Michael Porter, this framework identifies five forces that determine the competitive intensity and, therefore, the attractiveness (profitability) of an industry.

1. **Threat of New Entrants:** How easy is it for someone to copy you tomorrow?
2. **Bargaining Power of Buyers:** Can your customers easily squeeze your prices?
3. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** Are you dependent on a single vendor who can hike prices?
4. **Threat of Substitutes:** Is there a different way for customers to solve their problem without your *category* of product? (e.g., Netflix vs. Sleep, not Netflix vs. Disney+).
5. **Intensity of Rivalry:** Are you in a "price war" with direct competitors?

## Part 2: Strategizing with the Forces
As a CEO, your strategy should be to **position your company where the forces are weakest**.
- If Buyer power is high, build a brand people *must* have.
- If Rivalry is high, differentiate your product so you aren't compared on price.

## CEO Action Item: Industry Mapping
Pick the **one force** that is currently causing the most pressure on your business.
1. Identify the force.
2. Write down one strategic initiative that would "weaken" that force for you.
   *Example: "Buyer power is high because we have one big customer. Strategy: Diversify revenue to 10+ smaller customers."*
