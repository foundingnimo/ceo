# Episode 02: Defining Talent Needs

## Overview
Hiring the "wrong" person is one of the most expensive mistakes a CEO can make. To avoid this, you must define exactly what you need before you start looking. This goes beyond a simple job description.

## Key Concepts
- **Ideal Candidate Profile (ICP)**: Similar to an Ideal Customer Profile, the talent ICP defines the specific skills, experiences, and cultural attributes required for success in a role.
- **Skills-Based Hiring**: Focus on what the candidate can actually *do*, rather than where they went to school or their previous job titles.
- **Potential vs. Pedigree**: In a fast-growing startup, the ability to learn and adapt (potential) is often more valuable than having done the exact same thing at a larger company (pedigree).
