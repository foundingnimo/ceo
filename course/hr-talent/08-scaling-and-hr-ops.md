# Episode 08: Scaling & HR Ops

## Overview
There comes a point (usually around 25-50 people) where "Founder DIY HR" breaks. You need specialized People Operations to continue scaling successfully.

## Key Concepts
- **Hiring your first People lead**: Should you hire a "Recruiter" or a "Head of People"? (Hint: It depends on your growth rate vs. cultural stability).
- **HR Tech Stack**: Moving from spreadsheets to automated systems (HRIS, ATS, Payroll).
- **Compliance as Foundation**: Ensuring you have the legal and regulatory basics right so they don't become a distraction during a scale-up.
