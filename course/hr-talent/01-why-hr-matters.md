# Episode 01: Why HR Matters

## Overview
Many CEOs view Human Resources as an administrative "compliance" function—the place where payroll happens and people get fired. This is a mistake. In a technology company, your HR leader (Chief People Officer or HR Director) should be your most important strategic partner next to your CFO.

## Key Concepts
- **Administrative vs. Strategic HR**: Administrative HR manages the "mechanics" (payroll, benefits, policy). Strategic HR manages the "advantage" (culture, talent density, organizational design).
- **People over Process**: As exemplified by Netflix, the goal is to hire high-performers and then *get out of their way* by removing unnecessary processes.
- **The CEO-CHRO Relationship**: Your Head of People should be involved in every major business decision, as every decision has a people implication.

## CEO Action Item
Take 5 minutes to reflect: Does your HR lead have a "seat at the table" for strategic decisions, or are they only brought in to execute decisions already made?
