# Episode 06: High Performance Culture

## Overview
Culture is not about perks like ping-pong tables or free snacks. It is about the "behaviors" that you reward or tolerate.

## Key Concepts
- **The "Keeper Test"**: A Netflix-pioneered concept: *"If this employee told me they were leaving for a similar job at a peer company, would I fight hard to keep them?"* If not, they shouldn't be on the team.
- **Radical Candor**: Moving away from "polite" feedback to "clear and direct" feedback. Clarity is kindness.
- **OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)**: Aligning the entire organization toward the same "North Star" goals.

## CEO Action Item
Sit down with your direct reports and perform a "Shadow Keeper Test" on your key teams. Who are you "fighting to keep"? Who are you simply "tolerating"?
