# Episode 04: Recruiting: Art & Science

## Overview
Recruiting is a sales process, but with a "product" (the job) that can say no. As CEO, you are the Closer-in-Chief.

## Key Concepts
- **Structured Interviewing**: Using the same set of questions for all candidates to avoid bias and ensure comparable data.
- **The "Sell" vs. The "Assessing"**: Every interview must balance assessing the candidate's fit and selling them on the opportunity.
- **The CEO Interview**: Your role isn't to test technical skills (your team does that). Your role is to assess **Values Alignment**, **Ambition**, and **Trajectory**.
