# Episode 03: Employer Branding

## Overview
Your employer brand is not your marketing brand. It is the answer to the question: *"Why would a high-performer join your company instead of Google, Apple, or a bigger startup?"*

## Key Concepts
- **Authenticity Over Gloss**: Top talent can smell "corporate speak." Your brand should reflect the real, sometimes messy, reality of working at your company.
- **The Value Proposition for Talent (EVP)**: What do employees get in exchange for their talent? (Impact, autonomy, equity, growth, etc.)
- **Founders as Magnetic Pull**: In the early stages, the CEO's personal brand and vision are the primary reasons people join.

## CEO Action Item
Ask 3 of your best employees: "Why did you join us?" and "What is one thing about working here that is better than your last job?" Use their answers to sharpen your pitch.
