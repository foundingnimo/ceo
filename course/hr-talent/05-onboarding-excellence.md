# Episode 05: Onboarding Excellence

## Overview
Onboarding doesn't end on Day 1. It is a 90-day process that determines whether your expensive new hire will be a "regrettable turnover" or a high-performing contributor.

## Key Concepts
- **The First 100 Days**: Especially for executives, the first 100 days should be a structured journey from *Learning* to *Contributing* to *Leading*.
- **The CEO Welcome**: A personal touch from the CEO (video or meeting) sets the tone for the entire company culture.
- **Social Integration**: High performers stay because of the *work*, but they leave because they don't feel *connected*. Ensure they have a "Buddy" and meet key stakeholders early.

## CEO Action Item
Review your onboarding process. Do new hires meet you (or see a video from you) in their first week? Do they have a clear 30-60-90 day plan?
