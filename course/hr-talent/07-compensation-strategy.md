# Episode 07: Compensation Strategy

## Overview
Compensation is how you communicate what you value. In a startup, your "unfair advantage" is equity.

- **The Option Pool**: Why you need to reserve 10-20% of the company for employee equity and how to allocate it.
- **Total Rewards**: It's not just salary + equity. It's the mission, the autonomy, and the growth opportunities.
