# Episode 6: Breaking Silos (Cross-functional Alignment)

**Estimated Time:** 15 Minutes

The best product doesn't always win. The best *aligned* company does. If your Product team is building "A" but your Sales team is selling "B" and Engineering is fixing "C," you are leaking millions in value.

## Part 1: Shared Outcomes
In many companies, teams are measured by outputs:
- **Sales:** Measured by revenue.
- **Engineering:** Measured by tickets closed.
- **Product:** Measured by features shipped.

This creates silos. Instead, the CEO must force **Shared Outcomes.** If the goal is "Increase Retention by 10%," all three teams must work together to achieve it.

*Understand how to align different functional goals under a single strategic objective.*

## Part 2: The CEO’s Alignment Dashboard
You shouldn't be in every meeting, but you should know three things:
1. **The Conflict:** What is the primary disagreement between Product and Sales right now? (e.g., "Build new feature" vs. "Fix technical debt").
2. **The Sacrifice:** What are we *giving up* to resolve that conflict?
3. **The Proof:** How will we know, in 3 months, that we made the right choice?

## CEO Action Item: The Silo Walk
Bring your Heads of Product, Sales, and Engineering into a room for 30 minutes. Ask them:
- "If we could only achieve **one** thing as a company in the next 90 days, what would it be?"
- If they give three different answers, you have an alignment problem. Your job for the rest of the week is to get them to agree on **one.**
