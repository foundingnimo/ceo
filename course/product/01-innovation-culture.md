# Episode 1: The CEO as Innovation Architect

**Estimated Time:** 15 Minutes

The most common mistake CEOs make is trying to be the "Chief Idea Officer." Your job isn't to have all the ideas; it's to build a system that sorts the brilliant ones from the expensive failures.

## Part 1: The Innovator's Mindset
Innovation isn't a bolt of lightning; it's a process of elimination. As CEO, you must create "Psychological Safety"—the ability for your team to try an idea, prove it wrong, and move on without fear of punishment.

*Focus on the difference between "Sustaining" innovation (making things better) and "Disruptive" innovation (making things different).*

## Part 2: Building the Culture
An innovation culture requires three things from the CEO:
1. **Context over Control**: Give teams a vision (see Strategy Course) and let them find the solution.
2. **Tolerance for Failure**: Most experiments will fail. If you punish failure, you kill innovation.
3. **Relentless Curiosity**: Ask "How do we know this is true?" rather than "When will it be done?"

## CEO Action Item: The Experiment Audit
Ask your Product or Tech Lead: "What is one thing we tried in the last month that **didn't** work?"
- If they can't answer: You aren't experimenting enough. You are playing it too safe.
- If they can: Reward the learning. Ask what the *next* experiment is based on that failure.
