# Episode 2: Product Strategy vs. Product Features

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

Most CEOs treat their product roadmap like a grocery list of features requested by customers or sales reps. This is the path to a mediocre, bloated product. Real strategy is about **choices and trade-offs.**

## Part 1: The Feature Factory Trap
If your team is only focused on "What are we building next?", you are in a **Feature Factory.** You are shipping code, but are you shipping value?

*Listen for the definition of product strategy: A set of choices that positions the company to win in the market.*

## Part 2: The "Whole Product" Concept
A product isn't just the software. It’s the onboarding, the support, the pricing, and the ecosystem. As CEO, you must ensure the "Whole Product" works together.
- **Generic Product:** The software itself.
- **Expected Product:** What the customer thinks they are getting (e.g., security, uptime).
- **Augmented Product:** The things that set you apart (e.g., exceptional customer success).

## CEO Action Item: The Trade-off Test
Look at your current product roadmap.
1. Pick one major feature scheduled for next month.
2. Ask: "If we *don't* build this, what specific customer problem will go unsolved?"
3. Ask: "If we *do* build this, what are we **not** doing that might be more valuable?"
4. If you can't clearly articulate the trade-off, your strategy is likely just a wish list.
