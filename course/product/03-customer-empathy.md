# Episode 3: The Job to be Done (Customer Empathy)

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

## CEO Action Item: The Customer "Recall"
Call one of your actual customers this week. Don't pitch them. Ask them:
1. "Try to remember the day you decided to sign up for our product. What was happening in your business that day that made you say 'I need to find a solution for this'?"
2. "What were you using *before* us, and why was it failing you?"

*The answers to these questions are the foundations of your product's true value proposition.*
