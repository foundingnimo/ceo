# Episode 4: Build-Measure-Learn (The MVP)

**Estimated Time:** 30 Minutes

In the old world, you spent 12 months building a product and then hoped someone would buy it. In the "Lean" world, speed to shipping is secondary to **speed to learning.**

## Part 1: The Build-Measure-Learn Loop
The core of the Lean Startup methodology is a feedback loop. Your goal is to move through this loop as fast as possible.
1. **Build:** Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
2. **Measure:** See how customers actually use it (not what they say they'll do).
3. **Learn:** Decide whether to Pivot (change strategy) or Persevere (keep going).

*Understanding the radical idea that "shipping is learning."*

## Part 2: What is an MVP, Really?
An MVP isn't a "shitty" version of your final product. It is the **smallest possible thing** you can build to test your most risky assumption.
- **Bad MVP:** A buggy version of a 20-feature app.
- **Good MVP:** A single landing page that asks for an email address to prove people actually want the core value proposition.

## CEO Action Item: The Riskiest Assumption
1. Identify the most expensive feature your team is currently building.
2. Ask: "What are we assuming is true that, if it's false, makes this feature worthless?" (e.g., "We assume customers want to automate their payroll").
3. Ask: "Is there a way we could have tested that assumption with a manual process or a simple prototype *before* we wrote any code?"
