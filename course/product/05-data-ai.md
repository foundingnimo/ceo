# Episode 5: Data & AI (The Modern Lever)

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

As CEO, you are probably being told that "AI is the future." It is. But AI for AI's sake is just an expensive distraction. You must use Data and AI to drive **Customer Value.**

## Part 1: Data-Informed vs. Data-Driven
- **Data-Driven:** The numbers tell you what to do. (Dangerous for innovation).
- **Data-Informed:** You use data to identify patterns, but you use human judgment to decide the "Why."

## Part 2: The CEO’s AI Lens
When evaluating a new AI initiative, don't ask "Is it cool?" Ask:
1. **Does this solve a customer problem faster or cheaper?** (Efficiency).
2. **Does this allow us to solve a problem we couldn't solve before?** (New Capability).
3. **Do we have the data to support this, or are we just throwing GPUs at a guess?**

## CEO Action Item: The Metric Audit
Look at the dashboard you review every month.
- Are you looking at **Lagging Indicators** (Revenue, Churn) or **Leading Indicators** (Activation rate of new features, time to first value)?
- Ask your Product team for one "Leading Indicator" that predicts future growth and track that for the next 90 days.
