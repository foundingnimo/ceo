# Product Management & Innovation: The CEO's Guide

In a technology company, **the product is the business.** As CEO, you don't need to manage backlogs or write user stories, but you *must* be the architect of the environment where great products are born.

## Course Overview
This course focuses on the strategic side of product leadership. We will move away from "feature factories" and toward "empowered teams" that solve real customer problems.

### What You Will Learn:
1. **Innovation Architecture**: How to build a culture that experiments and learns.
2. **True Strategy**: How to differentiate through value, not just a list of features.
3. **Customer Empathy**: Using the "Jobs to be Done" framework to understand the 'why' behind the buy.
4. **Lean Execution**: Using MVPs and data to de-risk your biggest bets.

## Your Instructors (via curated content):
- **Marty Cagan**: The "godfather" of modern product management.
- **Clayton Christensen**: Harvard professor and father of Disruptive Innovation.
- **Eric Ries**: Creator of the Lean Startup methodology.
