# Episode 3: Leading By Example

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

> "Your team reflects your behavior, not your intentions."

Culture isn't what you say—it's what you do. Every CEO action is observed, interpreted, and multiplied across the organization. You are always on stage.

## Part 1: The Shadow of the Leader

People don't listen to your words. They watch:
- What you spend time on
- Who you promote
- What behavior you tolerate
- How you react under pressure

| What You Do | What It Teaches |
|:------------|:----------------|
| Check email during meetings | "This meeting isn't important" |
| Work weekends and brag about it | "Work-life balance is lip service" |
| Promote a brilliant jerk | "Results excuse bad behavior" |
| Skip 1:1s with direct reports | "People development isn't a priority" |

## Part 2: The Brilliant Jerk Problem

High performers who violate values present the ultimate culture test.

**The calculation:**
- Keeping them: Short-term output, long-term culture damage
- Firing them: Short-term pain, long-term culture credibility

**The math that matters:** For every brilliant jerk you tolerate, you lose your most values-aligned employees who won't compete on those terms.

**Reed Hastings (Netflix):** "Brilliant jerks are too costly to the effective functioning of a team. Jerky behavior in a colleague is so expensive to deal with that we cut those costs by refusing to have them."

## Part 3: Empowerment vs. Abdication

Empowerment is giving people authority *and* accountability. Abdication is dumping work without support.

| Empowerment | Abdication |
|:------------|:-----------|
| Clear context on goals and constraints | "Figure it out" |
| Access to resources and decisions | No decision rights |
| Defined success metrics | Vague expectations |
| Regular check-ins for support | Disappearing until deadline |
| Celebrating autonomous decisions | Punishing mistakes |

**The empowerment formula:**
1. Share the *why* (strategic context)
2. Define the outcome (not the method)
3. Agree on check-in cadence
4. Get out of the way
5. Give credit; take blame

## Part 4: Managing Your Energy

Your mood is contagious. When you're stressed, anxious, or burned out, the organization feels it.

**Non-negotiables for CEO self-management:**
- Protect thinking time (calendar blocks that aren't negotiable)
- Control your entrance (pause before walking into a room)
- Know your triggers (when do you react badly?)
- Build recovery (not optional; mandatory for sustainable leadership)

## CEO Action Item: The Mirror Exercise

Take 10 minutes:
1. List the top 3 behaviors you *want* to see in your culture.
2. For each: When did you *last* model this behavior publicly?
3. Ask yourself: If everyone behaved exactly like me this week, what culture would we have?

*The honest answer reveals the real culture you're building.*
