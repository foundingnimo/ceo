# Episode 1: Defining Core Values

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "Your culture is the behavior you tolerate." — Patrick Lencioni

Every company claims to have values. Few companies have values that actually *work*. The difference is whether values are wall art or decision-making tools.

## Part 1: What Values Actually Are

Values are **the principles that guide behavior when no one is watching.** They're not aspirations—they're descriptions of who you already are at your best.

| ❌ Aspirational Value | ✅ Behavioral Value |
|:----------------------|:--------------------|
| "Excellence" | "We ship on time even when it hurts" |
| "Integrity" | "We tell customers bad news immediately" |
| "Teamwork" | "Individual credit matters less than team wins" |

The test: Would you fire a high performer who violates this value? If no, it's not a real value.

## Part 2: Values vs. Mission vs. Vision

| Concept | Question | Example (Netflix) |
|:--------|:---------|:------------------|
| **Values** | How do we behave? | "Freedom and Responsibility" |
| **Mission** | Why do we exist? | "To entertain the world" |
| **Vision** | Where are we going? | "Become the best global entertainment distribution service" |

Values govern *how* you pursue the mission. They're the guardrails, not the destination.

## Part 3: The Values Discovery Process

Don't invent values—*discover* them:

1. **Look at your best people.** What behaviors make them exceptional?
2. **Look at your worst hires.** What was the *real* reason they didn't work? (Usually values, not skills.)
3. **Look at hard decisions.** When you chose the harder right over the easier wrong—what value were you protecting?

**Warning:** Avoid generic values that every company claims (Integrity, Innovation, Excellence). These say nothing unique about *your* culture.

## Part 4: Living the Values

Values must be **operationalized**, not just stated:

| Stage | How to Embed Values |
|:------|:--------------------|
| **Hiring** | Screen for values fit, not just skills |
| **Onboarding** | Tell stories that illustrate values in action |
| **Performance** | Evaluate *how* people achieve results, not just *what* |
| **Recognition** | Celebrate values-aligned behavior publicly |
| **Termination** | Values violations are firing offenses, even for stars |

## CEO Action Item: The Values Audit

Take 15 minutes:
1. Write down your company's stated values (without looking them up).
2. For each value: Name a recent decision where this value was *tested*—where you chose the value over convenience or short-term gain.
3. If you can't name an example, the value isn't real yet.

*This audit reveals the gap between stated and actual culture.*
