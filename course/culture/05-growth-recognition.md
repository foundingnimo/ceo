# Episode 5: Growth & Recognition

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

> "Train people well enough so they can leave. Treat them well enough so they don't want to." — Richard Branson

Top performers don't just want paychecks—they want growth. If they can't see a future at your company, they'll build it somewhere else.

## Part 1: Development is Retention

Why do people leave?
1. Limited growth opportunities
2. Poor management
3. Lack of recognition
4. Compensation (often *after* the other problems)

**The insight:** By the time someone leaves for money, they've already mentally checked out due to the first three factors.

## Part 2: The Growth Toolkit

| Tool | Description | Who Benefits |
|:-----|:------------|:-------------|
| **Career paths** | Clear progression showing how to advance | Everyone—removes guessing about growth |
| **Stretch assignments** | Projects slightly beyond current ability | High-potentials ready for more challenge |
| **Mentorship** | Senior guidance on navigating career | Mid-level talent seeking wisdom |
| **Sponsorship** | Advocate who actively creates opportunities | Underrepresented talent needing access |
| **Learning budget** | $ for courses, books, conferences | Self-directed learners |
| **Rotation programs** | Exposure to different functions | Early-career exploring interests |

**Key distinction:** Mentors give advice. Sponsors open doors. High-potentials need sponsors.

## Part 3: The Recognition Equation

Recognition costs almost nothing but produces massive returns.

| What People Need | How to Deliver It |
|:-----------------|:------------------|
| **Seen** | Acknowledge specific contributions |
| **Heard** | Act on their input |
| **Valued** | Connect their work to impact |

**The specificity rule:** "Great job!" is worthless. "Your analysis on the pricing model changed my mind and probably saved us from a bad decision" is powerful.

## Part 4: Recognition Systems

| Type | Frequency | Example |
|:-----|:----------|:--------|
| **Informal** | Daily/Weekly | Slack shoutouts, verbal thanks |
| **Team** | Weekly/Monthly | "Win of the week" ritual in team meetings |
| **Company** | Monthly/Quarterly | All-hands recognition, awards |
| **Monetary** | Quarterly/Annual | Bonuses, spot awards, equity grants |

**Warning:** Don't gamify recognition into a popularity contest. Recognize *specific behaviors*, not just visible roles.

## Part 5: The Feedback Flywheel

People can't grow without honest feedback. Most managers avoid it.

**The problem:** Avoiding hard conversations is easier today but creates surprises at review time.

**The solution:** Normalize continuous feedback.

| Practice | Mechanism |
|:---------|:----------|
| Weekly 1:1s | Manager asks: "What should I start/stop/continue?" |
| After meetings | Quick debrief: "What worked? What didn't?" |
| Project retrospectives | Structured review of what to improve |
| 360 feedback | Annual input from peers, reports, and managers |

## CEO Action Item: The Growth Conversation

This week, ask one direct report:
1. "Where do you want to be in 2-3 years?"
2. "What skills do you need to develop to get there?"
3. "What's one thing I could do to help you grow faster?"

*Then, follow through on whatever they say. Nothing builds trust like acting on feedback.*
