# Organizational Culture Building: The CEO's Guide

Culture is not a "soft" concern—it's a strategic weapon. In technology companies, culture determines whether you attract A-players, execute with speed, and adapt when markets shift. As CEO, you are the Chief Culture Officer whether you like it or not.

## Course Overview
This course moves beyond platitudes ("our culture is like family!") to the specific actions and systems that build high-performance cultures. Each episode is designed to be consumed in **5 to 45 minutes**.

### What You Will Learn:
1. **The Foundation**: How to define values that actually guide decisions.
2. **The Safety Net**: How to build psychological safety that unlocks candor.
3. **The Mirror**: Why your behavior *is* the culture, and how to lead by example.
4. **The Mosaic**: How diversity drives innovation (and how to actually do DEI).
5. **The Growth Engine**: How to develop people and recognize contributions.
6. **The Tech Context**: Unique culture challenges in remote, agile, and fast-changing environments.

## How to Use This Course:
