# Episode 6: Culture in Tech Companies

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "Culture eats strategy for breakfast, but in tech, the culture has to run at startup speed."

Tech companies face unique culture challenges: remote work, rapid change, engineer-dominant teams, and pressure to scale. What works for a 10-person startup breaks at 100. What works at 100 might kill you at 1,000.

## Part 1: The Remote/Hybrid Challenge

Distributed teams require *intentional* culture work:

| In-Office Culture | Remote Requires |
|:------------------|:----------------|
| Watercooler conversations | Scheduled informal time |
| Reading the room | Explicit communication |
| Spontaneous collaboration | Async-first work norms |
| Visible working hours | Outcomes over activity |

*GitLab has 1,500+ employees across 65+ countries with no offices.*

**Remote culture rules:**
1. **Default to async.** Synchronous meetings should be rare and purposeful.
2. **Write everything down.** Decisions in Slack threads must be documented.
3. **Over-communicate context.** What's obvious to you isn't obvious to them.
4. **Create rituals.** Virtual coffee chats, team celebrations, all-hands with real Q&A.

## Part 2: The Speed vs. Process Tradeoff

Startups move fast by avoiding process. Scale requires process. The culture challenge: add *enough* process without killing speed.

| Stage | Culture Need | Danger |
|:------|:-------------|:-------|
| Early stage (1-20) | Move fast, ship constantly, everyone does everything | Burnout, no documentation |
| Growth (20-100) | Specialize roles, add some process | Process overload, silos |
| Scale (100+) | Balance autonomy with alignment, clear decision rights | Bureaucracy, "not my job" |

**The frame:** Process should *enable* speed, not slow it down. If a process exists only for control, kill it.

## Part 3: Engineering Culture Specificity

Tech companies often have engineer-dominant cultures. This creates strengths and blind spots:

| Strength | Potential Blind Spot |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Logical, data-driven | Undervalues emotional intelligence |
| Meritocracy ideal | Ignores systemic advantages/disadvantages |
| "Best idea wins" | Loudest voice wins (not the same thing) |
| High autonomy | "Not my problem" on cross-functional work |

**CEO challenge:** Honor the technical culture while expanding the definition of excellence.

## Part 4: Innovation vs. Execution Balance

Culture must support *both* exploration (finding new things) and exploitation (optimizing existing things).

| Innovation Culture | Execution Culture |
|:-------------------|:------------------|
| Tolerance for failure | Zero tolerance for avoidable errors |
| Experimentation | Efficiency |
| "What if?" | "How do we?" |
| Bets | Commitments |

**The answer:** Don't choose. Create space for both. Example: Google's 70/20/10 model (70% core business, 20% adjacent, 10% moonshots).

## Part 5: Culture During Hypergrowth

Nothing kills culture faster than hypergrowth. What worked at 30 people doesn't work at 300.

**Hypergrowth culture threats:**
- Values get diluted (new hires outnumber old)
- Onboarding can't keep up
- Communication breaks down
- Founders become bottlenecks

**Countermeasures:**
1. **Document culture obsessively.** Netflix's Culture Deck, Stripe's Operating Principles.
2. **Slow down hiring before you break.** A bad hire at 50 people is a disaster.
3. **Promote culture carriers.** Put values-aligned people in management positions first.
4. **Maintain founder visibility.** All-hands, written memos, town halls—the CEO must stay present.

## CEO Action Item: The Scale Readiness Check

Answer honestly:
1. Could a new employee understand our culture from written documentation alone? (Yes/No)
2. Are we hiring faster than we can properly onboard? (Yes/No)
3. Have our values been tested and reinforced in the last 90 days? (Yes, with specific example)

*For any "No" or weak answer, that's your culture vulnerability. Fix it before the next growth spurt.*
