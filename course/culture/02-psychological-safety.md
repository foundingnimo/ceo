# Episode 2: Psychological Safety

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "There's no team without trust." — Paul Santagata, Google

Google's Project Aristotle studied 180+ teams to find what made some great and others mediocre. The #1 factor wasn't talent, resources, or leadership style—it was **psychological safety**.

## Part 1: What Is Psychological Safety?

Psychological safety is the belief that you won't be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.

| Low Safety Environment | High Safety Environment |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| People wait to speak until the boss speaks | People share ideas regardless of seniority |
| Mistakes are hidden | Mistakes are reported and analyzed |
| Disagreement feels risky | Disagreement is expected and welcomed |
| People say "yes" when they mean "maybe" | People flag concerns early |

**The innovation link:** Breakthroughs require experimentation. Experimentation requires failure. Failure requires safety.

## Part 2: The CEO's Role

You set the tone. Your behavior is watched, interpreted, and copied.

| CEO Behavior | What It Signals |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| Thanking someone for raising a problem | "Bad news is welcome here" |
| Taking notes when anyone speaks | "Every voice matters" |
| Saying "I was wrong about X" | "Admitting mistakes is safe" |
| Publicly punishing a failed experiment | "Don't take risks here" |

**You don't get to be fragile.** When someone challenges your idea, defend your position—but never attack the person.

## Part 3: Creating Candor Channels

People need structured ways to speak up:

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| **Anonymous surveys** | Surface issues people won't say publicly |
| **Skip-level 1:1s** | Let employees bypass their manager safely |
| **Retrospectives** | Normalize reflection on what went wrong |
| **"Disagree and commit"** | Make debate expected, not threatening |

**Critical:** If you ask for feedback and nothing changes, you've proven feedback is pointless. Close the loop publicly.

## Part 4: The Response to Bad News

How you react to the *first* piece of bad news determines whether you hear the *second*.

**The wrong response:**
- "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"
- "Whose fault is this?"
- Visible frustration, closed body language

**The right response:**
- "Thank you for telling me."
- "What do we need to do now?"
- "What can we learn from this for next time?"

## CEO Action Item: The Candor Test

This week:
1. In your next leadership meeting, explicitly ask: "What's something we're not talking about that we should be?"
2. Wait in silence for at least 10 seconds. (This will feel long. That's the point.)
3. When someone speaks, thank them *before* responding to the content.

*Notice the team's reaction. If no one speaks, you have a safety problem.*
