# Episode 2: Transparency & Trust

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

> "Trust is built in drops and lost in buckets." — Kevin Plank, Under Armour Founder

The single most important asset you have with your board is trust. And trust is built through one thing: **consistent transparency**.

## Part 1: Why Transparency Is Non-Negotiable

New CEOs often make one of two mistakes:
1. **Over-optimism**: Sharing only good news, spinning challenges
2. **Information hoarding**: Keeping the board at arm's length to "protect" autonomy

Both destroy trust. Here's why transparency works:

| Transparent CEO | Opaque CEO |
| :--- | :--- |
| Board hears about problems early | Board discovers problems late (or from others) |
| Directors can help proactively | Directors feel blindsided and defensive |
| CEO builds credibility over time | CEO loses credibility with each surprise |
| Board meetings are collaborative | Board meetings become interrogations |

### The #1 Rule: No Surprises

Board members hate surprises more than bad news. A missed quarter is manageable. A missed quarter the board didn't see coming is a crisis of confidence.

## Part 2: What to Share (And When)

You don't need to share everything—just everything that matters. Here's a framework:

| Category | What to Share | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financials** | Cash runway, burn rate, revenue vs. plan | Monthly |
| **Key Metrics** | The 3-5 KPIs that define success | Monthly |
| **Strategic Updates** | Major wins, losses, pivots | As they happen |
| **People** | Key hires, departures, performance issues | As they happen |
| **Risks** | Anything that could materially affect the business | Immediately |
| **Fundraising** | Pipeline, term sheets, strategy | As needed |

### What NOT to Do
- Don't wait until board meetings to share critical updates
- Don't bury bad news in slide footnotes
- Don't share so much detail that signal is lost in noise

## Part 3: Establishing Communication Cadence

The best investor relationships are maintained between board meetings, not during them.

**Recommended cadence:**
- **Monthly investor update email**: 15-minute read covering key metrics, wins, challenges, asks
- **Quarterly board meetings**: 2-2.5 hours of strategic discussion
- **Ad-hoc calls**: When major events occur (good or bad)
- **1:1s with each director**: At least quarterly, ideally monthly

## CEO Action Item: Draft Your Board Update Template

Take 15 minutes to create a template for your monthly board/investor update. Include:

1. **Top 3 highlights** this month
2. **Top 3 lowlights/challenges** this month
3. **Key metrics** (pick 3-5 that matter most)
4. **Cash position** and runway
5. **Specific asks** — what do you need help with?

Keep it to one page. The goal is consistency, not comprehensiveness.

> **Pro tip:** Send this update even when you have nothing exciting to report. Consistency builds trust.
