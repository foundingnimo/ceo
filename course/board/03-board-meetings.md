# Episode 3: Board Meetings That Actually Work

**Estimated Time:** 30 Minutes

> "The goal of a board meeting is not to present. It's to decide." — Sequoia Capital

Most board meetings are wasted. CEOs spend hours on slide decks, only to have directors read them for the first time during the meeting. The result: updates instead of decisions, monologues instead of dialogue.

Here's how to fix that.

## Part 1: The Anatomy of a Great Board Meeting

A well-run board meeting has three distinct phases:

| Phase | Timing | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pre-Meeting** | 3-5 days before | Share materials; directors read and prepare questions |
| **The Meeting** | 2-2.5 hours | Strategic discussion and decisions |
| **Post-Meeting** | Within 48 hours | Action items, follow-ups, 1:1 conversations |

### The Pre-Read: Your Secret Weapon

The board deck should be sent **at least 3 business days** before the meeting. It should contain:
- Financial summary (actuals vs. plan)
- Key metrics dashboard
- Strategic update (what's working, what's not)
- Specific decisions or input needed
- Appendix with detailed data for those who want it

**Format tip:** Keep the main deck to 15-20 slides. Put deep dives in the appendix.

## Part 2: Meeting Structure — Updates vs. Decisions

Here's a sample agenda for a 2-hour board meeting:

| Time | Topic | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0:00-0:05 | Welcome, approve minutes | Procedural |
| 0:05-0:15 | CEO summary (5-10 mins max) | Brief update, assumes pre-read |
| 0:15-0:45 | Strategic topic #1 | Discussion—bring questions to the room |
| 0:45-1:15 | Strategic topic #2 | Discussion—seek input on key decision |
| 1:15-1:35 | Financials & metrics Q&A | Q&A only—data in pre-read |
| 1:35-1:50 | Closed session | Board only, without management |
| 1:50-2:00 | Wrap-up, action items | CEO rejoins |

### The Golden Ratio
**80% discussion, 20% presentation.** If you're presenting more than you're discussing, you're doing it wrong.

## Part 3: Common Mistakes CEOs Make

| Mistake | Why It Happens | How to Fix It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reading slides aloud | Fear of silence | Send pre-reads; start with "You've read the deck. What questions do you have?" |
| Hiding bad news | Fear of judgment | Lead with challenges; boards respect honesty |
| Letting one director dominate | Poor facilitation | Actively call on quieter members; set discussion ground rules |
| No clear asks | Not knowing what you need | End each topic with "Here's what I need from you" |
| Surprises | Poor pre-meeting communication | If it's big news, call each director before the meeting |
| Running over time | Poor agenda discipline | Use a timer; assign a timekeeper |

## Part 4: The Closed Session

Every board meeting should include 15-20 minutes of "closed session" where the board meets without the CEO present. This is normal and healthy—don't take offense.

**What happens in closed session:**
- Directors share candid feedback about CEO performance
- Discuss compensation matters
- Raise concerns they don't want to voice in front of management

**Your job:** After the closed session, ask the board chair for direct feedback. "What was discussed? Anything I should know or act on?"

## CEO Action Item: Create Your Board Meeting Agenda Template

Take 20 minutes to design your ideal board meeting:

1. **Write out your standard agenda** using the format above
2. **Identify 2 strategic topics** you'd bring to your next board (real or hypothetical)
3. **For each topic, write:**
   - The decision or input you need
   - The 2-3 questions you want the board to discuss
4. **Set a calendar reminder** to send board materials 4 days before your next meeting
