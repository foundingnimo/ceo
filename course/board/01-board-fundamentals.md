**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "A great board doesn't run your company. They help you run it better." — Ben Horowitz

Before you can manage your board, you need to understand what a board actually is, why it exists, and what each person around the table is supposed to do. Many first-time CEOs learn this the hard way.

## Part 1: What Is a Board and Why Does It Exist?

A board of directors exists for one primary reason: **governance**. They represent shareholders' interests and ensure the company is being run responsibly.

For venture-backed startups, the board serves additional purposes:
- **Strategic guidance** — Experienced operators who've seen this movie before
- **Accountability** — Someone to answer to besides yourself
- **Network access** — Introductions to customers, talent, and future investors
- **Crisis support** — Steady hands when things get tough

## Part 2: Types of Board Members

Not all board members are created equal. Understanding their different motivations is critical.

| Type | Who They Are | What They Care About | Your Approach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Founder/CEO** | You | Building the company | Lead with vision and data |
| **Investor Directors** | VCs who invested | Their fund's returns | Show path to value creation |
| **Independent Directors** | Outside experts | Company health, governance | Leverage their expertise |
| **Board Observers** | Non-voting attendees | Staying informed | Keep them in the loop |

### Key Insight: Fiduciary vs. Advisory Boards

| Feature | Fiduciary Board | Advisory Board |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legal Status** | Formal, legally required | Informal, optional |
| **Voting Power** | Yes—can hire/fire CEO, approve major decisions | No—advisory only |
| **Liability** | Directors have legal duties | No legal obligations |
| **When to Use** | After raising institutional capital | Early stage, pre-funding |

## Part 3: CEO vs. Board — Who Does What?

This is where many CEOs get confused. The line is actually clear:

| Responsibility | Board | CEO |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hire/fire CEO | ✅ | ❌ |
| Set company strategy | Approve | Propose & Execute |
| Day-to-day operations | ❌ | ✅ |
| Major financial decisions (funding, M&A) | Approve | Propose |
| Compensation for executives | Approve | Propose |
| Company culture & execution | Advise | Own |

**The bottom line:** The board governs. You operate. When boards start operating, or CEOs start ignoring governance, things break.

## CEO Action Item: Map Your Board

Take 15 minutes and complete this exercise:

1. **List each board member** (current or planned)
2. For each person, answer:
   - What is their primary motivation for being on this board?
   - What unique expertise or network do they bring?
   - When was your last 1:1 conversation with them?
3. **Identify gaps**: What expertise is missing? Who should your next board member be?

If you don't have a board yet, sketch out your ideal board composition for when you raise your next round.
