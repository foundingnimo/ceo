# Episode 6: Crisis Communication

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining." — John F. Kennedy

Every company faces crises. The CEOs who survive them aren't necessarily smarter or luckier—they're better prepared and communicate more effectively when the storm hits.

## Part 1: The Anatomy of a Crisis

Crises that affect board/investor relationships typically fall into these categories:

| Crisis Type | Examples | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial** | Cash runway shortfall, missed projections, fraud | High |
| **People** | Key executive departure, founder conflict, HR scandal | Medium-High |
| **Product** | Major failure, security breach, customer data loss | High |
| **Market** | Competitor disruption, market collapse, regulatory change | Medium |
| **Reputation** | PR disaster, legal action, public criticism | Medium-High |

### What Makes Crises Worse

| Mistake | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hiding or downplaying | Trust destroyed when truth emerges |
| Slow communication | Investors hear from others first |
| Blame-shifting | You look weak and unaccountable |
| Panic | You make rushed decisions that make things worse |

## Part 2: The Crisis Communication Framework

When a crisis hits, use this framework: **ACT + FOLLOW**

### ACT (First 24-48 hours)

| Step | Action | Timing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A**ssess | Understand what happened, impact, known vs. unknown | First 2-4 hours |
| **C**ontact | Reach out to board/investors directly (phone, not email) | Same day |
| **T**ell | Share what you know, what you don't, and what you're doing | Within 24 hours |

### FOLLOW (Ongoing)

| Step | Action | Timing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **F**requent updates | Regular communication until resolved | Daily/weekly |
| **O**wn it | Take responsibility, don't deflect | Always |
| **L**earn | Conduct post-mortem, share learnings | After resolution |
| **L**ead | Show calm, decisive leadership | Throughout |
| **O**utcome focus | Keep focus on resolution and path forward | Always |
| **W**atch | Monitor for second-order effects | Ongoing |

## Part 5: Rebuilding Trust After a Crisis

Surviving a crisis is step one. Rebuilding trust takes longer.

| Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| Deliver on commitments made during crisis | Prove reliability |
| Share post-mortem and lessons learned | Show learning culture |
| Increase communication frequency temporarily | Demonstrate transparency |
| Acknowledge the impact | Show empathy and accountability |
| Execute your plan | Build track record |

**The trust recovery timeline:** Expect 2-3 quarters of consistent execution before trust fully recovers.

## CEO Action Item: Create Your Crisis Communication Checklist

Take 20 minutes to prepare for the crisis you hope never comes:

1. **List your crisis contacts** — who gets called first for each crisis type?
   - Board chair: [Name, phone]
   - Lead investor: [Name, phone]
   - Legal counsel: [Name, phone]
   - PR/comms: [Name, phone]

2. **Draft your "first call" script** using the template above

3. **Identify your company's top 3 crisis risks** — what's most likely to hit you?
   - Risk 1: [Description]
   - Risk 2: [Description]
   - Risk 3: [Description]

4. **For each risk, identify one preventive action** you could take this month

**Store this checklist somewhere accessible.** When a crisis hits, you won't have time to think clearly.
