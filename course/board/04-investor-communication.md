# Episode 4: Investor Communication

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "Under-promise and over-deliver. Every single time." — Jeff Bezos

Investor relations extends far beyond board meetings. The way you communicate with investors—especially between meetings—determines whether they become allies or adversaries.

## Part 1: Know Your Investors

Not all investors are the same. Understanding what drives each one helps you tailor your communication.

| Investor Type | What They Care About | Communication Style |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Seed/Angel** | Product-market fit, team, vision | More informal; they bet on you |
| **Series A/B VC** | Growth metrics, unit economics, market size | Data-driven; show the path to scale |
| **Growth Equity** | Profitability path, market leadership | Financial rigor; prove efficiency |
| **Strategic Investors** | Synergies with their business | Business development angle |

### Key Insight: Fund Dynamics Matter

Your VC investor isn't just an individual—they're part of a fund with its own pressures:
- **Fund size** affects how much your outcome matters to them
- **Fund stage** affects their time horizon and risk tolerance
- **Partner dynamics** affect how much support your deal gets internally

Ask your investors: "How does our company fit into your fund's portfolio? What does success look like for you?"

## Part 2: Setting and Managing Expectations

The fastest way to destroy investor trust is to miss expectations you set yourself.

### The Expectations Ladder

| Level | Example | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exceed** | "We'll hit $1M ARR" → You hit $1.3M | Trust increases; investor confidence grows |
| **Meet** | "We'll hit $1M ARR" → You hit $1M | Neutral; you're reliable |
| **Miss** | "We'll hit $1M ARR" → You hit $700K | Trust decreases; questions arise |
| **Surprise Miss** | Investor learns from someone else | Major trust damage; potentially unrecoverable |

### How to Set Expectations
1. **Be conservative** in projections—build in buffer
2. **Scenario plan** — share best case, expected case, and downside case
3. **Update often** — if trajectory is changing, say so early
4. **Own misses** — explain what happened and what you're doing about it

## Part 4: Handling Difficult Conversations

Sometimes you need to deliver bad news. Here's how:

| Situation | How to Handle |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Missed targets** | Own it immediately. Explain why, what you learned, what you're changing. |
| **Key person leaving** | Proactive call > email. Share your succession plan. |
| **Major pivot** | Frame as learning, not failure. Show the new opportunity clearly. |
| **Runway concerns** | Give maximum lead time. Share options and your recommendation. |
| **Unexpected competition** | Acknowledge it. Show why you're still positioned to win. |

**The Script for Bad News:**
1. State the issue directly (no burying)
2. Explain the context (what happened, why)
3. Take ownership (even if external factors played a role)
4. Share the plan (what you're doing about it)
5. Ask for support (specific help you need)

## CEO Action Item: Write Your Investor Update Template

Take 15 minutes to create your standard investor update:

1. **Draft the template** using the structure above
2. **Pick your 3-5 key metrics** — what numbers actually matter?
3. **Write one "Lowlight"** from this month and how you're addressing it
4. **Add one specific ask** — an intro, feedback, or resource you need

Send this to at least one investor this week—even if it's imperfect. Consistency beats perfection.
