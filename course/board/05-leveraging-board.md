# Episode 5: Leveraging Your Board

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

> "If you're only using your board for governance, you're leaving 80% of the value on the table." — Reid Hoffman

Many CEOs view board members as oversight—people to manage and satisfy. The best CEOs view them as strategic assets to deploy.

## Part 1: Your Board as a Strategic Asset

Board members, especially experienced VCs and operators, offer three types of value beyond governance:

| Value Type | Examples | Your Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Expertise** | They've seen your problem before at other companies | Ask for advice on specific challenges |
| **Network** | Customer intros, candidate sourcing, investor relationships | Make specific, targeted asks |
| **Pattern Matching** | They've watched 50+ companies at your stage | Ask "What have you seen work?" |

### The Mindset Shift

| Old Mindset | New Mindset |
| :--- | :--- |
| "How do I keep my board happy?" | "How do I extract maximum value from my board?" |
| "Board meetings are for reporting" | "Board meetings are for problem-solving" |
| "Don't bother them between meetings" | "Engage them proactively on key issues" |

## Part 2: The Art of the Ask

The single biggest way CEOs underutilize their board: **they don't ask for specific help**.

### What Makes a Good Ask?

| Bad Ask | Why It Fails | Good Ask |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "We need help with hiring" | Too vague | "We're looking for a VP Sales with PLG experience. Do you know anyone at [specific companies]?" |
| "Can you help us fundraise?" | Not actionable | "We're raising a Series B. Could you intro us to [specific partner] at [specific firm]?" |
| "Any customer intros?" | Unclear target | "We're trying to land [Company X]. Do you have relationships with anyone in their engineering org?" |

### How to Frame Your Asks

1. **Be specific** — Name the company, person, or role
2. **Provide context** — Why this matters, what you've already tried
3. **Make it easy** — Offer to draft the intro email they can forward
4. **Follow up** — Close the loop on every ask, whether it worked or not

## Part 3: Building 1:1 Relationships

Board meetings are for the group. The real relationship is built in 1:1s.

**Recommended cadence:** Meet with each board member 1:1 at least once per quarter—ideally monthly.

### What to Discuss in 1:1s

| Topic | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Personal check-in** | Build genuine relationship; you're humans, not just roles |
| **Your biggest current challenge** | Get unfiltered advice without the group dynamic |
| **Sensitive topics** | Discuss issues you're not ready to bring to full board |
| **Feedback on you** | Ask "What should I be doing differently?" |
| **Their expertise** | Deep-dive on areas where they have specific knowledge |

## Part 4: Board Committees

As your company grows, committees become useful for delegating specific governance functions:

| Committee | Purpose | Typical Members |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compensation Committee** | Set executive pay, equity grants | Independent directors |
| **Audit Committee** | Financial oversight, compliance | Independent with finance experience |
| **Nominating/Governance** | Board composition, CEO evaluation | Mixed |

**When to create committees:**
- Usually after Series B or when you have 5+ board members
- Required for public companies
- Useful when specific expertise is needed for decisions

## Part 5: When to Push Back

Leverage doesn't mean obedience. Great CEOs know when to push back on board input.

| Situation | Approach |
| :--- | :--- |
| Board suggests strategy you disagree with | Listen fully, then present your perspective with data. You're closer to the business. |
| Investor director pushes for faster growth | Explain trade-offs. Ask what they'd cut to fund more growth. |
| Board second-guesses tactical decisions | Gently redirect: "That's an operational call—here's the strategic question I'd love input on." |
| Conflicting advice from directors | Acknowledge both views, then share your synthesis and decision. |

**Remember:** You run the company. The board advises and governs. A strong CEO drives the agenda while remaining genuinely open to input.

## CEO Action Item: Create Your Board Leverage Plan

Take 15 minutes to maximize the value you get from your board:

1. **List each board member** 
2. For each, answer:
   - What's their unique expertise or network?
   - When did I last have a 1:1 with them?
   - What's one specific ask I should make of them this month?
3. **Schedule any overdue 1:1s** this week
4. **Draft one specific ask** for your next board meeting or investor update

**The test:** If you haven't asked your board for specific help in the last 30 days, you're underutilizing them.
