# Episode 6: AI & Data

**Estimated Time:** 30 Minutes

> "AI is the new electricity." — Andrew Ng

Every CEO is being bombarded with AI promises. Vendors claim AI will transform everything. Investors ask about your AI strategy. This episode gives you the grounding to separate hype from opportunity.

## Part 1: AI Demystified

At its core, AI is about pattern recognition. Here's what the buzzwords actually mean:

| Term | Plain English | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI** (Artificial Intelligence) | Software that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence | Spam filters, recommendation systems |
| **ML** (Machine Learning) | AI that learns from data rather than explicit programming | Netflix recommendations, fraud detection |
| **Deep Learning** | ML using neural networks with many layers | Image recognition, language translation |
| **LLM** (Large Language Model) | AI trained on text to generate human-like responses | ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot |
| **Generative AI** | AI that creates new content (text, images, code) | DALL-E, Midjourney, GitHub Copilot |

### The AI Capability Spectrum

```
Simple ────────────────────────────────────────────── Complex

[Rules]      [Statistics]      [ML]      [LLMs]      [AGI?]
   ↓              ↓              ↓          ↓           ↓
"If X then Y"  Predictions  Patterns   Generation   Science
                                                    Fiction
                                                    (for now)
```

## Part 2: What AI Can and Can't Do (Today)

### What AI Does Well

| Capability | Business Application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pattern recognition** | Fraud detection, churn prediction |
| **Recommendation** | Personalized content, product suggestions |
| **Classification** | Categorizing support tickets, leads |
| **Text generation** | Drafting content, summarization |
| **Code assistance** | Developer productivity |
| **Image/speech recognition** | Voice assistants, visual search |

### What AI Does Poorly

| Limitation | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Reasoning about novel situations** | Can't handle truly new problems |
| **Guaranteed accuracy** | May "hallucinate" false information |
| **Explaining its decisions** | Often a black box |
| **Understanding context deeply** | May miss nuance or sarcasm |
| **Knowing what it doesn't know** | Overconfident in wrong answers |

### CEO Bottom Line

AI is a powerful tool, not magic. It amplifies human capability rather than replacing human judgment. Use it where it excels, but don't bet your business on AI doing things it can't reliably do.

## Part 3: Data as a Strategic Asset

AI is only as good as the data it learns from. Your data strategy is your AI strategy.

### The Data Quality Pyramid

```
                    ┌────────────┐
                    │ AI/ML      │  ← Only works if foundation is solid
                    │ Insights   │
                ┌───┴────────────┴───┐
                │ Analytics          │  ← Dashboards, KPIs, trends
                │ & Reporting        │
            ┌───┴────────────────────┴───┐
            │ Data Integration           │  ← Clean, unified data
            │ & Quality                  │
        ┌───┴────────────────────────────┴───┐
        │ Data Collection                    │  ← Capturing the right data
        │ & Storage                          │
        └────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Questions to Assess Your Data Readiness

| Question | Good Answer | Red Flag |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Where does our customer data live?" | "Single source of truth" | "Multiple systems that don't sync" |
| "How clean is our data?" | "We have data quality processes" | "It's a mess, honestly" |
| "Can we access historical data?" | "Yes, well-organized" | "Scattered across spreadsheets" |
| "Who owns data quality?" | Named owner with accountability | "Everyone/no one" |

## Part 4: Evaluating AI Vendor Claims

AI vendors are especially prone to overselling. Use this framework:

### Red Flags in AI Pitches

| Claim | Reality Check |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Our AI is 99% accurate" | Accuracy on what data set? In what conditions? |
| "It just works out of the box" | AI always needs training and tuning |
| "It will replace X employees" | More likely to augment, not replace |
| "We use proprietary AI" | Usually means "we use APIs like everyone else" |
| "No technical expertise needed" | Someone still needs to manage and validate |

### Questions to Ask AI Vendors

1. **"What data do you need from us, and how is it used?"**
2. **"What's your accuracy on a data set like ours?"**
3. **"How much training/customization is required?"**
4. **"Can we see it fail? Show me the edge cases."**
5. **"What happens when it's wrong? How is that handled?"**
6. **"Who owns the model and the outputs?"**

## Part 5: Responsible AI Considerations

AI introduces ethical and legal considerations CEOs must understand:

| Issue | What It Means | CEO Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bias** | AI can perpetuate or amplify biases in training data | Audit AI outputs for fairness |
| **Privacy** | AI may require sensitive data | Ensure data handling complies with regulations |
| **Transparency** | Customers may have right to know how AI affects them | Have clear AI disclosure policies |
| **Accountability** | When AI makes a mistake, who's responsible? | Establish clear ownership and oversight |
| **Job displacement** | AI may change workforce needs | Plan for reskilling and transition |

## Part 6: Starting Your AI Journey

If you're not using AI today, here's a practical path forward:

| Phase | Focus | Timeline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Foundation** | Get your data house in order | 0-6 months |
| **2. Experiment** | Small pilots with clear success metrics | 6-12 months |
| **3. Scale** | Expand what works, kill what doesn't | 12-24 months |
| **4. Integrate** | AI becomes part of normal operations | Ongoing |

### Low-Risk Starting Points

| Area | AI Application | Why It's Low Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Developer tools** | GitHub Copilot, Cursor | Easy to try, high productivity gain |
| **Customer support** | AI-assisted ticket routing | Augments humans, doesn't replace |
| **Content** | First-draft generation | Human review catches errors |
| **Analytics** | Trend detection, anomaly alerts | Humans still make decisions |

## CEO Action Item: Identify One AI Opportunity

Take 20 minutes to evaluate AI potential for your business:

1. **List 3 repetitive tasks** in your company that consume significant time
2. **For each task, ask:**
   - Is this pattern-based? (AI-suitable)
   - Is accuracy critical? (Proceed carefully)
   - Do we have data to train on? (Required for most AI)
   - Would augmentation (AI + human) work? (Lower risk)
3. **Pick the best candidate** — lowest risk, highest potential time savings
4. **Schedule a discussion with your CTO** about feasibility

**Remember:** Start small, measure results, expand what works. AI is a marathon, not a sprint.
