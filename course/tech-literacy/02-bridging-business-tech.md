# Episode 2: Bridging Business & Tech

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

> "The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place." — George Bernard Shaw

Most CEO-engineering friction isn't about technology—it's about translation. Business and engineering speak different languages. Your job is to bridge them.

## Part 1: Two Different Worldviews

| Dimension | Business Perspective | Engineering Perspective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time** | "We need this by Q2" | "This will take 6 sprints ± 30%" |
| **Quality** | "Does it work?" | "Is it maintainable, scalable, secure?" |
| **Success** | Revenue, market share, customers | Uptime, code quality, system performance |
| **Risk** | Market risk, competitive risk | Technical risk, scalability risk |
| **Language** | ROI, ARR, churn | APIs, latency, refactoring |

Understanding these differences is the first step to effective communication.

## Part 2: Common Miscommunications

| CEO Says | Engineer Hears | What to Say Instead |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "This should be simple" | "You don't understand the complexity" | "Help me understand what's involved" |
| "Just make it work" | "Quality doesn't matter" | "What's the minimum viable solution?" |
| "Why is this taking so long?" | "You think I'm slow" | "Walk me through the blockers" |
| "Can't we just...?" | "Here comes a bad idea" | "I'm thinking about X—what am I missing?" |
| "The competitor did it in a week" | "You're comparing apples to oranges" | "What would it take to match that speed?" |

### The Deadly "Simple" Word

The word "simple" destroys trust faster than anything else. What seems simple from a business perspective (e.g., "add a button") may require touching dozens of systems, writing tests, handling edge cases, and coordinating deployments.

**Instead of:** "This should be simple"  
**Try:** "I don't have a sense of the complexity here—can you help me understand?"

## Part 3: Setting Context for Engineering Teams

Engineers work best when they understand the "why." Your job is to provide context, then let them determine the "how."

### The Context-Setting Framework

| Element | What You Share | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | The business outcome you need | "We need to reduce churn by 15%" |
| **Constraints** | Time, budget, non-negotiables | "We need to ship before the conference" |
| **Why Now** | Why this is urgent or important | "We're losing 3 customers a month to this issue" |
| **Who** | The customer or stakeholder | "Enterprise customers in healthcare" |
| **Success Criteria** | How you'll measure success | "Churn drops and NPS improves" |

**What you DON'T specify:** The technical solution. That's their expertise.

## Part 4: Getting Technical Information You Can Act On

When engineers give you updates, ensure you get information you can use:

### Questions That Cut Through Jargon

| Situation | Question to Ask |
| :--- | :--- |
| **They say it's "complex"** | "What's the breakdown? Where's the complexity?" |
| **They give a time estimate** | "What assumptions are in that estimate? What could make it take longer?" |
| **They say there's risk** | "What's the worst case? What's the probability?" |
| **You don't understand** | "Can you explain that like I'm a customer?" |
| **They recommend option A** | "What's the trade-off vs. option B?" |

### The "Explain Like I'm a Customer" Technique

When technical explanations get too deep, ask engineers to explain the impact in customer terms:

- ❌ "The database query is O(n²) which causes latency spikes under load"
- ✅ "When lots of users are on at once, the page loads slowly"

You don't need to understand the technical root cause—you need to understand the business impact.

## Part 5: Building Technical Trust

Trust is the foundation of effective CEO-engineering relationships:

| Trust Builder | How to Practice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Admit what you don't know** | "I don't understand containers—can you explain?" |
| **Defend engineering time** | Push back on scope creep and unrealistic deadlines |
| **Celebrate technical wins** | Recognize invisible work like refactoring and security |
| **Skip-level conversations** | Talk to individual engineers, not just managers |
| **Be consistent** | Follow through on commitments you make to engineering |

## CEO Action Item: Prepare for Your Next Engineering Sync

Take 15 minutes to prepare for more effective technical communication:

1. **Write down your top 3 business priorities** this quarter
2. **For each priority, draft context** using the framework above (Goal, Constraints, Why Now, Who, Success Criteria)
3. **Identify one thing you don't understand** about your current technology that you've been afraid to ask
4. **Schedule a 1:1 with an engineer** (not the CTO) to ask them directly

**Bonus:** Start your next engineering meeting with: "Before we dive in, let me share the business context..."
