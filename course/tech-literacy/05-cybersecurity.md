# Episode 5: Cybersecurity

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "There are two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those that don't know they've been hacked." — John Chambers, former Cisco CEO

Cybersecurity isn't just a technical issue—it's a business risk that lands on the CEO's desk. A major breach can destroy customer trust, trigger regulatory penalties, and end careers. You don't need to be a security expert, but you need to ask the right questions.

## Part 1: The CEO's Security Responsibility

| What You're Responsible For | What You're NOT Responsible For |
| :--- | :--- |
| Setting security as a priority | Configuring firewalls |
| Allocating appropriate budget | Writing secure code |
| Asking the right questions | Choosing specific tools |
| Ensuring accountability | Day-to-day security operations |
| Responding when breaches occur | Detecting intrusions |

**The bottom line:** You're responsible for ensuring the organization takes security seriously. The technical details are your team's job.

## Part 2: Common Threats You Should Understand

| Threat | What It Is | How It Happens | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phishing** | Fake emails/sites to steal credentials | Employee clicks malicious link | Account takeover, data theft |
| **Ransomware** | Encrypts your data, demands payment | Malware via email or exploit | Operations halt, ransom cost |
| **Data Breach** | Unauthorized access to sensitive data | Exploited vulnerability | Regulatory fines, trust damage |
| **Insider Threat** | Malicious or negligent employee | Disgruntled or careless staff | Data theft, sabotage |
| **Supply Chain** | Attack via trusted vendor | Compromised third party | Breach through trusted channel |

### Real-World Scale

- **Average cost of data breach:** $4.5M (IBM 2023)
- **Time to detect breach:** 207 days on average
- **Most common entry point:** Phishing (still works, every time)

## Part 3: Security Posture Assessment

These questions help you gauge your company's security maturity:

### Basic Questions to Ask Your CTO/CISO

| Question | Good Answer | Red Flag |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Do we have SOC2 certification?" | "Yes, Type II" or "In progress" | "What's SOC2?" |
| "When was our last security audit?" | Last 12 months | "We haven't done one" |
| "How do we handle employee offboarding?" | Automated, same-day access revocation | "IT handles it eventually" |
| "What's our password policy?" | MFA required everywhere | "Passwords only, no MFA" |
| "How are secrets managed?" | Vault, automated rotation | "In the codebase" or "Spreadsheet" |
| "What's our backup and recovery plan?" | Tested regularly, offsite | "We have backups" (untested) |

### Security Maturity Levels

| Level | Description | Signs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Ad Hoc** | No formal security program | Reacting to incidents only |
| **2. Basic** | Foundational controls in place | Passwords, basic access control |
| **3. Developing** | Formal policies, some auditing | SOC2 in progress, incident response plan |
| **4. Mature** | Continuous monitoring, testing | Regular pentests, security team, automated controls |
| **5. Optimized** | Security embedded in culture | Security by design, bug bounty program |

**Most startups** should aim for level 3-4 before Series B. Level 5 is for high-security industries.

## Part 4: When a Breach Occurs

Despite best efforts, breaches happen. Your response matters more than prevention:

### The First 24 Hours

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. **Contain** | Stop the bleeding—isolate affected systems |
| 2. **Assess** | What data was accessed? How bad is it? |
| 3. **Legal/Regulatory** | Engage counsel; determine notification requirements |
| 4. **Communicate** | Internal first, then board, then customers if required |
| 5. **Investigate** | Root cause analysis—how did this happen? |

### CEO Communication During a Breach

| DO | DON'T |
| :--- | :--- |
| Take responsibility | Blame individuals publicly |
| Be transparent about what you know | Speculate about what you don't |
| Explain what you're doing | Go silent |
| Prioritize customer impact | Focus only on legal exposure |
| Lead calmly | Panic or disappear |

### Regulatory Considerations

| Regulation | Who It Affects | Notification Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GDPR** | Companies with EU customers | 72 hours to authorities |
| **HIPAA** | Healthcare data handlers | 60 days typically |
| **CCPA** | California consumer data | "Without unreasonable delay" |
| **PCI-DSS** | Payment card data | Varies by card network |

**When in doubt:** Call your lawyer immediately. Notification requirements are complex.

## Part 5: Building a Security Culture

Security isn't just policies—it's culture. CEOs set the tone.

| Action | Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| Take security training yourself | Signals it matters |
| Include security in board updates | Elevates visibility |
| Fund security appropriately | Enables the team |
| React calmly to incidents | Encourages reporting |
| Thank people who find issues | Creates a security-aware culture |

## CEO Action Item: Schedule a Security Posture Review

Take 15 minutes to set this up:

1. **Schedule a 1-hour meeting with your CTO/CISO** (or whoever owns security)
2. **Ask the "Basic Questions"** from Part 3 above
3. **Request a summary of:**
   - Last security audit findings
   - Current top 3 security risks
   - Security investments needed in the next 12 months
4. **Add a "Security Update" section** to your quarterly board materials

**If you don't have anyone clearly owning security,** that's your first action item: assign ownership.
