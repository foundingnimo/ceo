# Episode 2: Measuring What Matters (KPIs & Metrics)

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

"What gets measured gets managed" is a cliché because it's true. But the *wrong* measurements create perverse incentives and busy-work. This episode teaches you to build a dashboard that tells you what's *actually* happening in your business.

## Part 1: The Three Layers of Metrics

Not all metrics are equal. Think of them as a pyramid:

| Layer | What It Measures | Who Cares | Example |
|-------|------------------|-----------|---------|
| **Outcome Metrics** | Business results | CEO, Board | Revenue, NPS, Churn |
| **Leading Indicators** | Predictors of outcomes | Leadership Team | Sales pipeline, Activation rate |
| **Activity Metrics** | Daily work | Teams | Deploys per week, Tickets closed |

**CEO Trap:** Getting lost in activity metrics. You don't need to know how many tickets were closed—you need to know if customers are happy and staying.

## Part 2: The "Operational Visibility" Test

Ask yourself: *Could a major problem brew for 30 days without me knowing?*

If yes, you have an **operational visibility problem.**

Signs of poor visibility:
- Surprises in board meetings ("I didn't know churn was that bad")
- Teams reporting "green" while customers are complaining
- You only learn about problems when they become crises

## Part 3: Building Your CEO Dashboard

Your dashboard should answer these questions at a glance:

1. **Are we acquiring customers?** (Pipeline, Conversion Rate)
2. **Are customers happy?** (NPS, CSAT, Support Ticket Trends)
3. **Are customers staying?** (Churn Rate, Net Revenue Retention)
4. **Are we building efficiently?** (Velocity, Lead Time, Defect Rate)
5. **Are we sustainable?** (Burn Rate, Runway, Cash Position)

> "If you have more than 5 metrics, you have none." — Focus ruthlessly.

## Part 4: Lagging vs. Leading Indicators

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Lagging** | Results that have already happened | Revenue, Churn, NPS Score |
| **Leading** | Predictors of future results | Qualified pipeline, Feature adoption |

**CEOs often over-index on lagging indicators** (they're in the board deck). But by the time you see a lagging indicator move, it's often too late. Build systems to track leading indicators so you can *act before* outcomes deteriorate.

## CEO Action Item: The 5-Metric Challenge

1. Write down the 5 most important metrics for your business right now.
2. For each one, answer:
   - Where does this data come from?
   - How often is it updated?
   - Who is accountable if this metric goes red?
   - What's the leading indicator that predicts this metric?
3. If you can't answer these questions confidently, that's your first operational gap to close.
