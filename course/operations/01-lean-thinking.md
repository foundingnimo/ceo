# Episode 1: The War on Waste (Lean Thinking)

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

If you remember only one thing from this course, let it be this: **Waste is the enemy.** Every hour your team spends on work that doesn't deliver customer value is an hour you can never get back.

## Part 1: What is Lean?

Lean is a management philosophy born in Toyota's factories. Its core insight: *most of what we do doesn't create value.* The goal is relentlessly eliminating "waste" (called *Muda* in Japanese) to focus resources on what actually matters.

### The 8 Wastes (TIMWOODS)

| Waste | Example in Tech |
|-------|-----------------|
| **T**ransportation | Hand-offs between teams; tickets bouncing between departments |
| **I**nventory | Features built but not shipped; PRs sitting unreviewed |
| **M**otion | Context switching; excessive meetings |
| **W**aiting | Blocked on approvals; waiting for dependencies |
| **O**verproduction | Building features no one asked for |
| **O**verprocessing | Gold-plating; unnecessary quality gates |
| **D**efects | Bugs caught in production; rework |
| **S**kills (unused) | Senior engineers doing data entry; not listening to front-line ideas |

*Focus on the five core principles: Value, Value Stream, Flow, Pull, and Perfection.*

## Part 2: Value Stream Mapping

The first step to eliminating waste is *seeing* it. A **Value Stream Map** visualizes every step from customer request to delivered value, exposing where time and effort are lost.

### Quick Example:
A bug goes from "reported" to "fixed in production."
- **Total time:** 3 weeks
- **Actual work time:** 4 hours

Where did the other 119 hours go? That's the waste you're hunting.

## Part 3: The CEO's Role in Lean

You don't personally eliminate waste—you **create the culture** where waste-hunting is celebrated:

1. **Ask "Why?" five times.** When a process seems slow, dig to the root cause.
2. **Celebrate problems found**, not just problems solved.
3. **Give teams permission** to stop and fix issues (Toyota's "Andon Cord").

## CEO Action Item: The 5-Why Exercise

Pick the most frustrating delay or bottleneck in your company right now. Then:

1. Ask "Why does this happen?" — Write down the answer.
2. Ask "Why?" about that answer. Repeat 5 times.

**Example:**
- Problem: Releases are slow.
- Why? → Waiting for QA sign-off.
- Why? → QA team is overloaded.
- Why? → Not enough automated tests.
- Why? → Engineers don't prioritize test coverage.
- Why? → "Moving fast" is rewarded, test-writing is punished.

The 5th "why" usually reveals a **cultural or systemic issue**—exactly where CEO attention is needed.
