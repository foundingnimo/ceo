# Episode 5: Strategy-Operations Alignment

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

You can have the best processes in the world and still fail—if those processes are optimizing the wrong things. Operational excellence without strategic alignment is just efficient irrelevance.

## Part 1: The Alignment Problem

Most companies suffer from alignment drift:
- **Strategy says:** "We're a premium product for enterprise customers."
- **Sales is measured on:** Total contract count (so they chase small deals).
- **Engineering prioritizes:** Features the loudest customer requested.
- **Support is incentivized on:** Ticket close rate (not customer outcomes).

Everyone is "performing well" by their local metrics while the company underperforms globally.

## Part 2: The Cascade Framework

Alignment happens through a cascade:

```
Vision & Mission
      ↓
  Strategic Priorities (3-5 year focus areas)
      ↓
  Annual Objectives (OKRs or equivalent)
      ↓
  Team Goals (directly traceable to objectives)
      ↓
  Individual Priorities (what each person works on)
```

At every level, teams should be able to answer: **"How does my work connect to the company's strategic priorities?"**

If they can't answer that question, you have an alignment problem.

## Part 3: The CEO's Alignment Rituals

**Weekly:** Ask in leadership meetings: "What's blocking us from our top 3 priorities?"
**Monthly:** Review metrics that matter. Are we moving the needle on strategic goals?
**Quarterly:** Full OKR reviews. What's off track? What resources need reallocation?
**Annually:** Strategic planning. What's changed? What do we stop, start, continue?

## Part 4: Local Optimization vs. Global Optimization

**Local optimization:** Making one team or process as efficient as possible.
**Global optimization:** Making the *whole system* as effective as possible.

These often conflict:

| Local Win | Global Loss |
|-----------|-------------|
| Sales closes deals faster (fewer checks) | More churn from bad-fit customers |
| Engineering ships features faster (less testing) | More incidents, customer trust erodes |
| Support closes tickets faster | Customers give up, don't renew |

Your job as CEO is to fight for global optimization even when local metrics look good.

## CEO Action Item: The Traceability Test

1. Pick 3 random team members from different parts of the company.
2. Ask each: "What are you working on this week, and how does it connect to our top strategic priorities?"
3. Listen carefully. Can they make a clear connection?

**If yes:** Celebrate it. Alignment is working.
**If no:** You've found a gap. Either the strategy isn't communicated, or the work isn't aligned.

Either way, you've learned something actionable.
