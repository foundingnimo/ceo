# Episode 6: Technology as Enabler (Not Savior)

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

"We need AI." "We need to automate." "We need digital transformation." Maybe. But technology solves nothing on its own. Applied poorly, it just makes bad processes faster.

## Part 1: The Automation Trap

The instinct: "This process is broken. Let's automate it."
The reality: **Automating a bad process gives you a faster bad process.**

Before you automate anything, ask:
1. Should we do this at all? (Eliminate)
2. Can we simplify it? (Reduce)
3. Can we standardize it? (Make repeatable)
4. *Now* can we automate it? (Scale)

> "The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency." — Bill Gates

## Part 2: The Build-Buy-Partner Decision

Every technology decision comes down to:

| Option | When to Choose | Watch Out For |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Build** | Core competitive advantage; nothing in market fits | Engineering distraction; maintenance burden |
| **Buy** | Commodity capability; faster time-to-value | Vendor lock-in; customization limits |
| **Partner** | Specialized expertise; temporary need | Dependency; knowledge doesn't accrue in-house |

**CEO rule of thumb:** Build only what differentiates. Buy everything else.

## Part 3: Digital Transformation — Without the Hype

"Digital transformation" has become a meaningless buzzword. What it *actually* means:

1. **Data fluency:** Decisions are made with data, not gut.
2. **Process digitization:** Manual handoffs become automated workflows.
3. **Customer experience:** Digital-first interactions (self-service, real-time).
4. **Culture:** Continuous experimentation and iteration.

The failure pattern: Companies treat digital transformation as an IT project. It's not. It's an **operating model change** that happens to use technology.

## Part 4: The CEO's Technology Questions

You don't need to understand the code. You need to ask the right questions:

1. **What problem does this solve?** (Not "what does it do?")
2. **How will we measure success?**
3. **What's the total cost of ownership?** (Including implementation, training, maintenance)
4. **What happens if the vendor disappears?**
5. **How does this integrate with what we already have?**
6. **What's the change management plan?** (Technology is easy; adoption is hard)

## Part 5: AI — A CEO's Realistic View

AI is powerful. It is not magic. A realistic view:

| AI is Good At | AI is Bad At |
|---------------|--------------|
| Pattern recognition in large data sets | Explaining *why* something happened |
| Automating repetitive decisions | Novel situations outside training data |
| Speed and consistency | Nuance, ethics, edge cases |

**CEO guidance for AI adoption:**
- Start with low-risk, high-volume use cases (support triage, document processing)
- Keep humans in the loop for decisions that matter
- Invest in data quality—garbage in, garbage out
- Don't chase hype; chase ROI

## CEO Action Item: The Technology Audit

1. List the last 3 technology investments your company made (software, tools, platforms).
2. For each one, answer:
   - What problem was it supposed to solve?
   - Is it actually solving that problem?
   - What's the adoption rate? (% of intended users actually using it)
   - What's the ROI?

If you can't answer these questions, you're investing in technology without accountability. That's how budgets disappear.
