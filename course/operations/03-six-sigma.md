# Episode 3: Reducing Variability (Six Sigma for CEOs)

**Estimated Time:** 20 Minutes

Lean eliminates waste. Six Sigma eliminates **variability.** If one customer's onboarding takes 2 days and another's takes 2 months—with no explanation—you have a quality problem.

## Part 1: What is Six Sigma?

Six Sigma is a methodology for reducing defects and inconsistency in any process. The name comes from statistics: at "Six Sigma" quality, you have only 3.4 defects per million opportunities.

You don't need to become a statistician. You need to understand the *mindset*:

> **Every process has an output. That output has variation. Reduce variation → improve quality → reduce cost.**

## Part 2: DMAIC — The Problem-Solving Engine

Six Sigma uses a 5-step framework called **DMAIC**:

| Step | Action | CEO Question |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **D**efine | What's the problem? | "What specifically is broken?" |
| **M**easure | How bad is it? | "What data do we have?" |
| **A**nalyze | Why is it happening? | "What's the root cause?" |
| **I**mprove | What's the fix? | "What's the smallest change that will move the needle?" |
| **C**ontrol | How do we keep it fixed? | "How will we know if it breaks again?" |

This isn't just for factories. Apply DMAIC to:
- Why did churn spike last quarter?
- Why is hiring taking 90 days?
- Why do 20% of deployments cause incidents?

## Part 3: The CEO's Role in Quality

You're not running the DMAIC analysis yourself. You're setting the **expectation that quality matters.**

**Three CEO behaviors that drive quality:**

1. **Never accept "it's always been like that"** — if a process is broken, demand root cause analysis.
2. **Celebrate defect prevention**, not just firefighting heroes.
3. **Give teams time to improve processes** — if teams are 100% utilized shipping features, they have 0% capacity to improve how they work.

> "Inspection does not improve the quality, nor guarantee quality. Inspection is too late. The quality, good or bad, is already in the product." — W. Edwards Deming

## Part 4: Quality vs. Speed — The False Trade-off

Many CEOs believe "if we slow down to focus on quality, we'll ship less." This is backwards.

**Defects are the ultimate time-waster:**
- Bugs require investigation (time)
- Bugs require fixes (time)
- Bugs require re-testing (time)
- Bugs erode customer trust (revenue)

Investing in quality *upstream* (better code reviews, better tests, better processes) saves multiples of that time downstream.

## CEO Action Item: The Variability Hunt

1. Pick one customer-facing process (e.g., onboarding, support ticket resolution, sales cycle).
2. Find out:
   - What's the *average* time to complete?
   - What's the *fastest* it's ever been?
   - What's the *slowest*?
3. If the gap between fastest and slowest is more than 2x, you have a variability problem.
4. Ask the team: "Why is there such a range? What causes the slow ones?"

That conversation will surface process gaps, handoff problems, or unclear ownership—all fixable.
