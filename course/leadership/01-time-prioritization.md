# Episode 1: Time & Prioritization

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities." — Stephen Covey

As CEO, your time is your most constrained resource. Everyone wants a piece of it. Without ruthless prioritization, you'll spend your days reacting instead of leading.

## Part 1: The Eisenhower Matrix

President Eisenhower famously distinguished between urgent and important. Most CEOs spend too much time on urgent-but-not-important tasks.

| | **Urgent** | **Not Urgent** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Important** | **DO** — Crises, deadlines, key meetings | **SCHEDULE** — Strategy, relationships, learning |
| **Not Important** | **DELEGATE** — Most emails, many meetings | **ELIMINATE** — Time wasters, low-value activities |

### Where CEOs Get Trapped

| Trap | What It Looks Like | The Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Quadrant 1 addiction | Living in crisis mode | Build systems to prevent fires |
| Quadrant 3 confusion | Confusing others' urgency for your priorities | Ask: "Is this important to *our* goals?" |
| Quadrant 4 escape | Busywork when stressed | Recognize avoidance behavior |
| Quadrant 2 neglect | Never time for strategy or relationships | Protect this time first, not last |

## Part 2: Time Blocking

Time blocking means scheduling specific activities in advance rather than reacting to what comes up.

### A CEO Time Blocking Framework

| Block Type | Purpose | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deep Work** | Strategy, thinking, writing | Daily, 2-3 hours |
| **1:1s** | Direct reports, key relationships | Weekly batches |
| **External** | Customers, investors, partners | Batched days |
| **Buffer** | Unexpected issues, overflow | Daily, 1 hour |
| **Personal** | Exercise, family, recovery | Non-negotiable |

### Rules for Time Blocking

1. **Block deep work first** — Before your calendar fills with meetings
2. **Batch similar activities** — All 1:1s on one day, external meetings on another
3. **Protect buffer time** — Things always take longer than expected
4. **Color code** — Visual clarity on how you're spending time
5. **Review weekly** — Did reality match intention?

## Part 3: The Power of Saying No

Every "yes" is a "no" to something else. Most CEOs say yes too often.

### Why Saying No Is Hard

| Reason | Reality |
| :--- | :--- |
| "I might miss an opportunity" | You're definitely missing opportunities by being overcommitted |
| "They'll be upset" | They'll respect clear priorities more than broken promises |
| "I can handle it" | You can, but at what cost? |
| "It won't take long" | It always takes longer |

### How to Say No

| Situation | Response |
| :--- | :--- |
| Meeting request | "I'm not the right person for this. Can [name] help?" |
| New project | "I'd love to, but I'm at capacity. What should I deprioritize?" |
| Favor request | "I can't commit to that now. Check back next quarter." |
| Scope creep | "That's out of scope for this initiative." |

**The magic phrase:** "Let me check my priorities and get back to you." This buys time to decide thoughtfully.

## Part 4: Calendar Audits

You can't improve what you don't measure. A weekly calendar audit reveals the gap between intention and reality.

### The 15-Minute Calendar Audit

Every Friday, review your week:

1. **Categorize** each hour: Strategic, Operational, Reactive, Personal, Wasted
2. **Calculate** percentages (or time totals) for each category
3. **Compare** to your ideal distribution
4. **Identify** the biggest leaks
5. **Adjust** next week's blocks accordingly

### Ideal CEO Time Distribution (Benchmark)

| Category | Target | Warning Sign |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Strategic (Q2) | 30-40% | Under 20% consistently |
| Direct reports | 20-25% | Skipping 1:1s regularly |
| External (customers, investors) | 15-20% | Losing touch with market |
| Reactive/Buffer | 10-15% | 0% means you're overbooked |
| Personal/Recovery | 10-15% | Skipping = burnout path |

## CEO Action Item: Audit Your Past Week

Take 15 minutes to understand how you actually spent your time:

1. **Pull up your calendar** for the past 5 workdays
2. **For each block**, assign a category: Strategic, Operational, Reactive, Personal, Wasted
3. **Calculate the breakdown** — what percentage went where?
4. **Identify your top 3 time leaks** — meetings that didn't need you, reactive work, escapes
5. **Block time next week** for one thing you've been neglecting (probably Quadrant 2)

**Bonus:** Do this audit weekly for a month. Patterns will emerge.
