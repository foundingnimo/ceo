# Episode 6: Authenticity & Purpose

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are." — Carl Jung

The most sustainable leaders don't perform a role—they lead from who they actually are. Authenticity and purpose provide the foundation for long-term effectiveness and fulfillment.

## Part 1: What Authenticity Is (And Isn't)

| Authenticity Is | Authenticity Isn't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Being genuine in values and intentions | Sharing everything you think or feel |
| Consistency between words and actions | Being unfiltered or impulsive |
| Owning your strengths and weaknesses | Refusing to adapt or grow |
| Leading from your real self | Performing a "CEO character" |

### The Authentic Leadership Advantage

| Authenticity Enables | How |
| :--- | :--- |
| Trust | People sense genuineness and respond to it |
| Resilience | Harder to burn out when not pretending |
| Better decisions | Aligned with your actual values |
| Team loyalty | People follow leaders they believe in |
| Sustainable energy | Not exhausting yourself maintaining a facade |

### The Trap: Corporate Persona

Many CEOs create a "CEO persona"—a performance of confidence, certainty, and strength that differs from who they really are. This works temporarily but:
- Exhausts you over time
- Creates distance from your team
- Makes you fragile when challenged
- Eventually cracks under pressure

## Part 2: Leading From Your Values

Values aren't what you say—they're what you do, especially under pressure.

### Identifying Your Core Values

Answer these questions:
1. When you've made decisions you're proud of, what principles were you following?
2. When you've felt most alive at work, what was present?
3. What behavior in others frustrates you most? (Often an inverted value)
4. What would you never compromise, even at significant cost?

### Living Values Under Pressure

| When This Happens | Value Test |
| :--- | :--- |
| Easy path conflicts with stated values | Do you take the harder right path? |
| Short-term gain vs. long-term integrity | Do you choose long-term? |
| Pressure to hide uncomfortable truth | Do you stay transparent? |
| Team member violates values but hits numbers | Do you address it? |

**Key insight:** Your team watches what you do, not what you say. They'll adopt your actual values.

## Part 3: Purpose Beyond Profit

Profit is a result, not a purpose. The most effective CEOs are driven by something more.

### Finding Your Purpose

Purpose answers: **Why does this work matter to me?**

| Shallow Purpose | Deeper Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Make money" | "Provide financial security for my family and employees" |
| "Build a successful company" | "Prove that ethical businesses can win" |
| "Be the market leader" | "Transform how people [do something important]" |
| "Create shareholder value" | "Build something that outlasts me" |

### Purpose Under Stress

When times are hard (and they will be), purpose provides:
- Motivation when milestones feel distant
- Decision clarity when options are ambiguous
- Resilience when setbacks accumulate
- Energy when you're depleted

Without purpose, these periods lead to burnout or quitting.

## Part 4: Authenticity vs. Oversharing

Authenticity doesn't mean transparency about everything.

### What to Share

| Share | Be Cautious About |
| :--- | :--- |
| Your values and why they matter | Your deepest fears and insecurities |
| Lessons from your failures | Current crises while you're processing |
| Your uncertainty about the future | Doubts about specific people |
| How you're feeling (in general) | Details of personal problems |
| Your "why" for decisions | Every internal debate |

### The Leader's Burden

Some things you carry alone:
- Personnel decisions in progress
- Confidential investor conversations
- Your own doubts during company crises
- Information that would hurt without helping

**Find other outlets:** Coach, therapist, peer CEO group, spouse (appropriately).

## Part 5: Maintaining Motivation Through Setbacks

Every CEO faces periods of doubt, frustration, and exhaustion. How do you keep going?

### When Motivation Fades

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Remedy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Everything feels meaningless | Disconnected from purpose | Revisit your "why" |
| Nothing excites you | Burnout | Rest, then reassess |
| You resent the company | Values misalignment | Honest evaluation |
| You want to quit | Many possible causes | Talk to someone before deciding |

### Reconnecting to Purpose

When motivation fades, try:
1. Talk to a customer whose life you've improved
2. Re-read your original vision/founding documents
3. List what you're proud of accomplishing
4. Imagine who you'd let down by quitting
5. Ask: "Is this temporary exhaustion or fundamental misalignment?"

### When It Might Be Time to Move On

Sometimes the right answer is to step down. Consider it if:
- Your values fundamentally conflict with the company's direction
- You're no longer the right leader for this stage
- The personal cost is destroying your health or relationships
- You've lost belief in the mission

This isn't failure—it's wisdom. The courage to leave can be as important as the courage to stay.

## Part 6: Building a Legacy

What do you want to be known for?

### Legacy Thinking

Periodically ask:
- If I left tomorrow, what would people say about my time here?
- What systems or culture would persist without me?
- What would I regret not having done?
- Am I building something I'm proud of?

### Living Your Legacy Now

Legacy isn't for later—it's built daily:
- Every decision reflects your values
- Every interaction shapes the culture
- Every choice about your time reflects priorities
- Every crisis reveals your character

## CEO Action Item: Write Your Personal Leadership Philosophy

Take 20 minutes to articulate who you are as a leader:

1. **My core values are:** (List 3-5)
   - [Value] — This means I will always...
   - [Value] — This means I will never...
   
2. **My purpose as a leader is:** (Complete the sentence)
   "I lead because..."

3. **I am at my best when:**
   
4. **I am at my worst when:** (Be honest)

5. **The legacy I want to build is:**

Keep this document. Revisit it annually. Share it with your team if it feels right.
