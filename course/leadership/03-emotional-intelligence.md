# Episode 3: Emotional Intelligence

**Estimated Time:** 25 Minutes

> "Anyone can become angry—that is easy. But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—this is not easy." — Aristotle

Technical skills get you the CEO role. Emotional intelligence determines whether you keep it—and whether you can lead effectively while you have it.

## Part 1: The Four Components of EQ

Emotional intelligence isn't one skill. It's four:

| Component | Definition | CEO Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Self-Awareness** | Knowing your emotions, triggers, and biases | Prevents reactive decisions |
| **Self-Regulation** | Managing your reactions under pressure | Maintains team stability |
| **Empathy** | Understanding others' perspectives and emotions | Builds trust and loyalty |
| **Social Skills** | Managing relationships and influence | Enables effective leadership |

Most CEOs overestimate their EQ. Studies show leaders consistently rate themselves higher than their teams rate them.

## Part 2: Self-Awareness — Knowing Your Triggers

Self-awareness is the foundation. You can't manage what you don't recognize.

### Common CEO Triggers

| Trigger | Typical Reaction | Better Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Feeling challenged or questioned | Defensive, dismissive | Curious: "Tell me more about your concern" |
| Missing targets | Searching for blame | Ownership: "What can we learn?" |
| Surprises | Anger, frustration | Pause: "I need a moment to process" |
| Perceived incompetence | Micromanaging | Coaching: "What support do you need?" |
| Time pressure | Curtness, rushing | Acknowledgment: "I'm stressed. Let me reset." |

### Identifying Your Triggers

Ask yourself:
1. When was the last time I reacted in a way I later regretted?
2. What was happening right before that reaction?
3. What pattern do I see across multiple incidents?

Ask others:
- "When do I seem most stressed or reactive?"
- "What triggers should I be more aware of?"

### Understanding Your Biases

Everyone has cognitive biases. CEOs are especially prone to:

| Bias | What It Is | CEO Manifestation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Confirmation bias | Seeking info that confirms beliefs | Ignoring bad news about your strategy |
| Sunk cost fallacy | Continuing because you've invested | Sticking with failing initiatives |
| Attribution error | Blaming others, crediting yourself | "I succeeded; they failed" |
| Overconfidence | Overestimating your judgment | Ignoring expert advice |

## Part 3: Self-Regulation — Managing Under Pressure

Knowing your triggers isn't enough. You need techniques to respond rather than react.

### The STOP Technique

When you feel triggered:

| Step | Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S**top | Pause before responding | Interrupt the automatic reaction |
| **T**ake a breath | Slow, deep breath | Activates parasympathetic nervous system |
| **O**bserve | Notice what you're feeling | Create distance from the emotion |
| **P**roceed | Choose your response intentionally | Respond, don't react |

### Recovery Phrases

Have phrases ready for when you need time:
- "That's an interesting point. Let me think about it."
- "I want to give this the attention it deserves. Can we revisit tomorrow?"
- "I'm noticing I'm having a strong reaction. Give me a moment."

### The 10-Minute Rule

For important decisions or responses when you're emotional:
- Write the email/response, then wait 10 minutes before sending
- The bigger the stakes, the longer the wait

## Part 4: Empathy — Understanding Others

Empathy isn't sympathy (feeling sorry for someone) or agreement (they're right). It's understanding their perspective.

### Three Types of Empathy

| Type | What It Is | CEO Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cognitive** | Understanding how someone thinks | Anticipating board concerns |
| **Emotional** | Feeling what someone feels | Supporting struggling team member |
| **Compassionate** | Understanding + motivation to help | Taking action on what you understand |

### Building Empathy Practices

| Practice | How to Do It |
| :--- | :--- |
| Active listening | Listen to understand, not to respond |
| Perspective-taking | Before reacting, ask "What might they be experiencing?" |
| Skip-level conversations | Talk to people 2-3 levels down regularly |
| Shadow a role | Spend a day doing someone else's job |
| Ask follow-up questions | "How did that make you feel?" |

## Part 5: Seeking and Receiving Feedback

The CEO role is often isolated. Actively seeking feedback is essential for continued growth.

### Why CEOs Get Less Feedback

| Reason | Reality |
| :--- | :--- |
| Power dynamics | People fear negative consequences |
| Success narrative | "You're the CEO, you must know" |
| Filtered information | Reports tell you what you want to hear |
| Ego protection | You may unconsciously discourage it |

### How to Get Honest Feedback

| Technique | How |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ask specific questions | "What's one thing I could do better in 1:1s?" not "Any feedback?" |
| Normalize criticism | "I'm working on X—I'd appreciate honest input when you see me struggling" |
| Respond well publicly | Thank people who give hard feedback; others will notice |
| Use anonymous surveys | 360 reviews, engagement surveys |
| Find a truth-teller | One person who will always be candid |

### Receiving Feedback Well

| Do | Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Thank them | Defend or explain |
| Ask clarifying questions | Dismiss or minimize |
| Reflect before responding | React immediately |
| Follow up on what you've changed | Let it disappear |

## CEO Action Item: Identify Your Top 3 Triggers

Take 15 minutes to build self-awareness:

1. **Reflect on the past month:** When did you react in ways you later regretted?
2. **Identify 3 triggers:** What situations or behaviors set you off?
3. **For each trigger, write:**
   - What typically triggers me: [situation]
   - My typical reaction: [behavior]
   - A better response would be: [alternative]
4. **Choose one practice** to implement this week (STOP technique, 10-minute rule, recovery phrases)
5. **Ask one trusted person:** "What triggers should I be aware of that I might not see?"

**Remember:** Self-awareness is a practice, not a destination. Check in with yourself regularly.
