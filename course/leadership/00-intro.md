# Personal Leadership & Self-Management: A Masterclass for CEOs

Welcome to your personal command center. This course is designed for CEOs who understand that leading others effectively starts with leading yourself.

## Why This Matters

The CEO role is uniquely demanding: intense pressure, high stakes, constant decision-making, and often profound isolation. Many CEOs are so focused on managing the business that they neglect to manage themselves—until burnout forces the issue.

Self-management isn't selfish. It's a prerequisite for sustainable leadership.
