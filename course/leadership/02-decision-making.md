# Episode 2: Decision-Making

**Estimated Time:** 30 Minutes

> "In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing. The worst thing you can do is nothing." — Theodore Roosevelt

CEOs make dozens of consequential decisions every week—often with incomplete information, time pressure, and high stakes. Decision quality, not decision quantity, determines leadership effectiveness.

## Part 1: The Nature of CEO Decisions

Most CEO decisions are different from everyday choices:

| Everyday Decisions | CEO Decisions |
| :--- | :--- |
| Clear right answer | Multiple valid options |
| Full information available | Incomplete, contradictory data |
| Reversible | Often irreversible or expensive to change |
| Affect few people | Affect many people |
| Low stakes | High stakes |

**Key insight:** Waiting for certainty is itself a decision—often the wrong one.

## Part 2: One-Way vs. Two-Way Doors

Jeff Bezos famously distinguishes between two types of decisions:

| Type | Definition | Approach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **One-Way Door** | Irreversible or very costly to reverse | Deliberate, seek input, take time |
| **Two-Way Door** | Easily reversible, low cost to change | Decide fast, learn from results |

### Examples

| One-Way Door | Two-Way Door |
| :--- | :--- |
| Major acquisition | Pricing experiment |
| Firing a co-founder | New marketing channel |
| Pivoting the business | Feature launch |
| Taking on major debt | Vendor choice (if switchable) |

**The mistake:** Treating two-way doors as one-way doors, leading to analysis paralysis on reversible decisions.

## Part 3: A Decision-Making Framework

For important decisions, use a structured approach:

### The DECIDE Framework

| Step | Action | Questions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **D**efine | Clarify the decision | What exactly are we deciding? What's the deadline? |
| **E**xplore | Gather information | What do we know? What don't we know? Who knows more? |
| **C**onsider | Generate options | What are all possible paths? What are we missing? |
| **I**dentify | Evaluate trade-offs | What's the upside/downside of each? Who's impacted? |
| **D**ecide | Choose and commit | Given uncertainty, which path do we take? |
| **E**valuate | Learn from outcomes | What happened? What would we do differently? |

### When to Use Frameworks vs. Intuition

| Use Frameworks When | Trust Intuition When |
| :--- | :--- |
| High stakes, one-way door | You have deep domain experience |
| Multiple stakeholders | Speed matters more than optimization |
| Novel situation | Pattern matches past successes |
| Strong emotions involved | Decision is easily reversible |

## Part 4: Avoiding Analysis Paralysis

Overthinking kills more good decisions than lack of thinking.

### Signs You're Overthinking

| Sign | What's Happening |
| :--- | :--- |
| Requesting more data indefinitely | Avoiding the decision |
| Scheduling "one more meeting" | Distributing accountability |
| Waiting for consensus | Consensus isn't your job |
| Seeking certainty | Certainty doesn't exist |
| Re-analyzing the same data | Fear of being wrong |

### Breaking Paralysis

1. **Set a deadline** — "I will decide by Friday at 3pm"
2. **Define "good enough"** — What information would make you 70% confident?
3. **Ask "What's the cost of waiting?"** — Inaction has costs too
4. **Assign a decision-maker** — If it's you, stop delegating the choice
5. **Make it reversible if possible** — "Let's try this for 30 days"

## Part 5: Post-Decision Commitment

Once you decide, commit. Second-guessing undermines execution.

| Do | Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| Communicate the decision clearly | Leave room for interpretation |
| Explain the reasoning | Just issue an edict |
| Define success metrics | Leave it vague |
| Set review checkpoints | Never revisit |
| Kill debate on the decision | Let lobbying continue |
| Stay open to new information | Be dogmatic forever |

### The "Disagree and Commit" Principle

When stakeholders disagree with your decision:
- Hear them out fully before deciding
- Once decided, ask for their commitment to execute
- "I understand you disagree. I need you to commit to making this work."

This preserves relationship while maintaining progress.

## Part 6: Learning from Decisions

The best CEOs treat decisions as learning opportunities.

### The Decision Journal

Keep a log of important decisions:

| Date | Decision | Why I Made It | Expected Outcome | Actual Outcome | What I Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1/1 | Hired VP Sales from competitor | Strong track record, culture fit concerns | 50% chance of success | TBD | TBD |

Review quarterly. Patterns will emerge about your decision-making strengths and weaknesses.

## CEO Action Item: Apply a Framework to a Pending Decision

Take 20 minutes to improve one decision you're currently facing:

1. **Identify a decision** you've been avoiding or deliberating
2. **Classify it:** One-way or two-way door?
3. **If one-way door:** Use the DECIDE framework. Write out each step.
4. **If two-way door:** Why haven't you decided yet? Just decide.
5. **Set a deadline** for the decision if you haven't already
6. **Start a decision journal** — log this decision as your first entry

**Remember:** A good decision made today is often better than a perfect decision made too late.
