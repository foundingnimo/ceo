# CEO Augmentation Program: Integrated Learning Plan

## Philosophy

This learning plan is designed for **parallel learning** across domains. CEOs face multi-domain challenges daily—financial decisions involve board communication, product decisions require team alignment, and strategy connects to operations. Learning in parallel mirrors how you'll apply these skills.

## How to Use This Plan

- **Commit to 1-2 hours per week** of learning
- **Complete one "wave" every 4-6 weeks**
- **Do the CEO Action Items**—they're where learning becomes real
- **Customize based on urgency**—if you're fundraising, prioritize Wave 3; if you're scaling, prioritize Wave 4
