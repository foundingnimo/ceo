- Current business stage and challenges
- Personal strengths and gaps
- Strategic priorities for the next 6-12 months

### 2. Deep Dive into Priority Areas
For each priority area, read the corresponding section thoroughly. Each section includes:
- **Why It Matters** - The strategic importance of this competency
- **Core Competencies** - Detailed breakdown of what you need to know and be able to do

### 3. Create Your Learning Plan
For each priority area, develop a learning plan that includes:
- **Formal Education** - Courses, workshops, certifications
- **Experiential Learning** - On-the-job application and practice
- **Mentorship** - Advisors, coaches, peer CEOs who excel in this area
- **Self-Study** - Books, articles, podcasts, case studies

### 4. Implement and Measure
- Set specific, measurable goals for each competency area
- Schedule regular time for learning and development
- Track progress quarterly
- Adjust priorities as your business evolves

### 5. Expand Over Time
As you build proficiency in your initial priority areas, expand to additional competencies. The goal is continuous improvement across all ten areas over time.

## Next Steps

This plan provides the foundation. To make it actionable, you can:

1. **Expand Individual Sections** - Create detailed learning curricula for each competency area with specific resources, exercises, and milestones
2. **Add Assessment Tools** - Develop rubrics or self-assessment questionnaires for each area
3. **Build Resource Libraries** - Curate books, courses, articles, and tools for each competency
4. **Create Action Templates** - Develop templates for board decks, financial models, strategic plans, etc.
5. **Establish Peer Learning** - Connect with other CEOs working on similar development goals

## Philosophy

This plan is built on several core beliefs:

- **CEOs are made, not born** - Leadership competencies can be learned and developed
- **Continuous learning is essential** - The best CEOs remain perpetual students
- **Depth matters more than breadth** - It's better to develop deep competency in a few areas than superficial knowledge across many
- **Application drives learning** - Reading about leadership is valuable; practicing it is transformative
- **Context matters** - Adapt these principles to your specific industry, company stage, and situation

## Contributing

- Resources you found particularly valuable
- Practical lessons learned from application
- Templates and tools you develop
- Case studies from your own experience

These additions will make the plan more valuable for future use and for others who might benefit from it.
